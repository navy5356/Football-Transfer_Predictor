46,Everton make enquiry for Barcelona's unwanted striker Paco Alc√°cer,"Barcelona are stepping up their efforts to move on unwanted players ahead of making key additions to the squad this summer. The club has already sold Gerard Deulofeu and have offers on the table for Yerry Mina and Paulinho, although the objective is to get rid of those Ernesto Valverde doesn't want first. One of those is Paco Alcacer, whose future is up in the air following the failed attempt by the club to sign Antoine Griezmann. Everton are the last team to enquire about Mina, but also asked about Alcacer. They wanted the striker back in January and could bid for him now. Barcelona's idea is to sell Alcacer if they receive a good offer for him. The objective is to recoup as much of the ‚Ç¨30m they invested in him two seasons ago. Alcacer is well liked in the Premier League and his asking price is within most English sides' budgets. Everton now have all the information they need and must decide whether to make a bid or not. In fact, Barcelona are set to meet with Alcacer's representatives next week. They are going to examine all the possible options available to the striker and let him know that he isn't part of their plans. In January, Alcacer refused to leave Barcelona. For the player it's important he choses another promising project and one where he doesn't need to reduce his wage. Everton, for now, have shown their interest in him.",FALSE

54,'Please lock him in the dressing room!' ‚Äì Liverpool fans worried about losing Mohamed Salah to Real Madrid following Ronaldo transfer,"Cristiano Ronaldo completed a stunning transfer to Juventus on Tuesday afternoon, leaving fans of a number of Europe's biggest clubs terrified. Los Blancos need to sign a replacement for their departed star, who left the Bernabeu after nine years of world class service. Paris Saint-German duo Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are rumoured to be high on Real's transfer shortlist, while Eden Hazard, the Chelsea forward, and Mohamed Salah of Liverpool are also known targets. Salah, the Egypt international, penned a new contract with Liverpool earlier this month on the back of the best debut season in Premier League history, and perhaps the best campaign enjoyed by any player since the top flight was rebranded in 1992. He scored a remarkable 44 goals in 52 appearances in all competitions, as Liverpool reached the Champions League final , while he was also named PFA Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. Understandably, Salah earned admiration from across Europe, and now might be the time Real turn their interest into a formal bid for the superstar. This has caused concern amongst the Anfield faithful, who do not want to see another key player make the move from Merseyside to Spain after Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho joined Barcelona in recent years.

55,"Harry Kane could join Real Madrid if Gareth Bale replaces him at Tottenham Hotspur, says Adrian Durham","Harry Kane could well leave Tottenham Hotspur, but only if Real Madrid consider a swap deal for Gareth Bale. That's according to talkSPORT's very own Adrian Durham, who was reacting to the news Cristiano Ronaldo is to join Juventus. The Portuguese captain will join the Serie A side in a ¬£99million move after Los Blancos accepted the monster bid for his services. With one superstar set to leave, speculation as to who could replace Ronaldo has already begun to intensify, with Kane unsurprisingly near the top of the list. The England captain is one of the deadliest marksmen in Europe and Durham believes a deal could be done this summer. He said: ""If Real Madrid come in with a massive bid, it's not inconceivable Spurs fans ‚Äì there is nothing in the law that says he has to stay at Spurs forever. ""So if Real Madrid come in with this massive bid, it might not even be about money, it might be about; 'Hang on a minute, I have the got the chance to be an absolute legend, look at Bale, at a football club with the history that Real Madrid have got.' ""Real Madrid could dominate over Barcelona, that hasn't happened in a while, certainly not in LaLiga."" Spurs have a history of working with the Champions League holders, having signed Rafael van der Vaart from them in a surprising deal back in 2010. However, they have also allowed superstars to swap north London for the Bernabeu in the past. After Luka Modric left in 2012, Gareth Bale joined Real the following summer and could well be on the move again. The Wales international has often been linked with moves away from Spain , despite playing a pivotal role in all three of the club's recent Champions League victories. When asked if he could see swap deal happening with Bale, Durham replied: ""I do yeah. ""That could be part of the deal, the Bale thing.

Mahrez was the subject of four failed bids from Manchester City in the mid-season transfer window and after a move to the Etihad did not materialise he missed training for over a week , with the Algeria international forced to deny going AWOL.

59,Man Utd transfer news: Paul Pogba holds secret meeting with Barcelona director in LA,"Manchester United midfielder Pogba has endured two mixed years at Old Trafford since his arrival from Juventus. The player is currently on holiday in the United States after winning the World Cup with France. But his stint at United may be coming to a close after fresh revelations emerged in the Italian media today. According to newspaper Tuttosport, Pogba met with Barca's new technical director Abidal in Beverly Hills. The France star is supposedly on Barcelona's summer wish list - although a move before Spain's August 31 transfer deadline may prove unlikely. United manager Jose Mourinho has endured a fractious relationship with Pogba over their two seasons together at Manchester United . Things came to a head midway through last season when the Portuguese boss dropped the former world's most expensive player from his starting XI. Juventus emerged as suitors of Pogba this summer but the ¬£105m signing of Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid meant they could not also afford another superstar deal. Tuttosport was the newspaper that broke the Ronaldo story towards the start of July - but equally they claimed Lionel Messi could be heading to Inter Milan! Today's report says Abidal and Pogba met not at a luxury hotel but in a private villa at the request of Barcelona - adding a sense of mystery to the meeting. The Barca director - new to the role this summer - is supposedly wary of being seen with a player contracted to another club. He has already overseen the capture of Malcom from Bordeaux - a deal that almost didn't take place after Roma initially agreed a fee with the Ligue 1 club and led to Barcelona hastily making a counter offer.

He's very quick and is different to what we have in the squad ."" That prompted reports that Messi had asked the Camp Nou board to make inquiries as to Pav√≥n's availability . Last season, he provided the highest number of assists in the Argentinean top flight as Boca were crowned champions.

It has left the 28-year-old mulling over his options and, according to AS, Manchester United are still pursuing him. The winger has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford and this summer could be the moment it finally happens.

After just a year he was promoted to the first-team squad by new manager Jorge Jesus and his competitive debut soon followed, coming on in injury time during his side's 1-0 win over Benfica in the Portuguese Super Cup. Martins then made his first Primeira Liga appearance on August 14, 2015, coming on late again in a 2-1 success against newly promoted Tondela. Martin's breakthrough season came during the 2015/16. Competing for a regular starting spot under Jesus, he played 42 games in all competitions, scoring seven goals and producing four assists. However, it was the following season where he really rose to prominence. As a regular starter, he scored six goals and produced nine assists - the most in the Primeira Liga. His real breakthrough night came against Real Madrid in the Champions League. Sporting may have lost 2-1 on the night at the Bernabeu but Martins shone for the visitors, terrorising Real's defence with his pace and trickery. It was a performance that is thought to have impressed his fellow countryman Cristiano Ronaldo, who then reportedly urged Real Madrid to sign the winger. Last season he improved again, scoring 13 goals and providing 13 assists in 52 games season in all competitions. His performances saw him named in the Europa League squad of the season by UEFA after helping Sporting reach the quarter-finals. Martins was a member of Portugal's squad for the 2014 UEFA European U19 Championship. He featured in every game as Portugal finished runners-up to Hungary. He also featured at the 2015 FIFA U20 World Cup. He scored against Senegal in the Group Stage and New Zealand in the last 16 before Portugal suffered a quarter-final exit on penalties at the hands of Brazil The 23-year-old received his first call-up to the senior team in September, 2016 for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and the Faroe Islands.

He has gone on to make 18 appearances for his country and has been selected by Fernando Santos for Portugal's World Cup squad. ""Gelson Martins will be the future Cristiano Ronaldo,"" said Benfica president Domingos Estanislau. This comparison may seem a little wide of the mark bearing in mind Ronaldo's superstar exploits in the game but Martins style of play is reminiscent of a young Cristiano. Martins has pace to burn and the skills to beat a man. He's a classic winger with excellent dribbling skills and he loves to beat his opposite man on the outside before getting a cross into the box.

Martins was believed to have cancelled his Sporting contract after supporters stormed the club's training ground. However, it appears that is not as cut and dry as thought, with Sporting making a last ditch attempt to keep hold of the winger. According to Portuguese newspaper Record , Sporting president Sousa Cintra met Martins in Lisbon yesterday. And Cintra was apparently trying to convince the 23-year-old to back down from cancelling his contract. Martins' team-mate Rafael Leao, who's also looked into quitting Sporting, was in attendance at the meeting too. And Arsenal will be desperately hoping Martins does not decide to stay at the Estadio Jose Alvalade after all. Martins has a ¬£53m (‚Ç¨60m) release clause written into the contract which seems to still be in effect at Sporting. Arsenal are unlikely to be able to stump that up, with a projected net spend of ¬£50m on the cards. Liverpool and Lazio face disappointment if Martins sticks with Sporting as well. Meanwhile, Martins and Leao were joined in wanting to leave Sporting following the training ground attack by Daniel Podence and Bruno Fernandes. Cintra reckons that duo could end up reversing their own decisions to move on to pastures new though. ""With Podence and Bruno Fernandes there can be understanding, their place is in Sporting, I'm dealing with this subject,"" said Cintra.",TRUE
100,Arsenal transfer news: Gelson Martins issues demand as Gunners consider free agent swoop,"Martins is one of the hottest properties in world football with a clutch of top sides showing interest in signing him. And he became an even more attractive proposition earlier this month when he cancelled his contract amid the chaos at Sporting. Martins was one of six players to cut ties with the Lisbon giants following an attack by fans on their training ground. The 23-year-old cited ""just cause"" to do so having carefully consulted with various lawyers to go over his options. Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport indicate Martins is aware Sporting might be awarded damages if the case goes to court though. And they claim he is therefore demanding his next club cover the cost of compensating Sporting if that transpires. Sporting could request millions for Martins, who had a mega ¬£53m release clause written into the deal he tore up. And the prospect of having to hand over an as yet unknown quantity of cash for a player who was supposed to be a free agent may put potential suitors off. Martins is also said to be demanding a bumper pay day, with one of Arsenal 's rivals for his signature, Lazio, possibly being priced out of a move. Lazio cannot offer more than ¬£2.2m (‚Ç¨2.5m) a year in wages to the man they had lined up to replace Felipe Anderson. And that may give an advantage to Arsenal, who also face having to pay out hefty commissions to any agents involved in the agreement. Alongside Arsenal and Lazio, Benfica are apparently serious about signing Martins ahead of the 2018/19 campaign. However, Corriere dello Sport do not say whether Arsenal and Benfica have followed Lazio in making contact over a deal.",FALSE

Barca scouts have been monitoring the 18-year old at the ongoing European U19 Championships, where Quina scored a sensational for goal Portugal against Italy. His performances there have also alerted a string of other scouts from clubs across Europe, including Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen in Germany. Quina is in the last year of his contract, with West Ham willing to sell for around ¬£600,000, according to Sky sources. Quina joined the Hammers on a free transfer from Chelsea two years ago but has only made six senior appearances since. He was impressive for the Hammers' U23s last season, however, with two goals in 18 appearances.",FALSE
102,Manchester United make proposal to sign Afonso Sousa,"Manchester United have made contact with an associate of Porto youngster Afonso Sousa, according to reports in Portugal. Sousa, 18, has been playing with Porto's B side and a string of impressive performances have seen the midfielder tipped to make the first-team at the Estadio do Dragao. However, with only a year remaining on his current contract at Porto, Sousa is being linked with a move away and several clubs are understood to be interested in his signature. O Jogo suggests that the Red Devils have approached Sousa's former agent, Carlos Goncalves, about a potential switch to Old Trafford. It's claimed Barcelona and four other Premier League teams have also made proposals to sign the highly-rated teenager. Porto, though, are desperate to keep hold of Sousa and have scheduled talks over a possible new deal. United have already signed Diogo Dalot, 19, from Porto this summer and Jose Mourinho is confident that the defender can be a success in England. 'Diogo is an extremely talented young defender with all the qualities to quickly become a great player for this club,' Mourinho said. 'He has all the attributes that a full-back needs: physicality, tactical intelligence and technical quality, combined with a Porto Academy mentality which prepares players for the maturity they need at the professional level.' Dalot admitted that he was looking forward to working with Mourinho after completing his move to United. 'Joining Manchester United is an unbelievable opportunity for me. I have grown up in Porto's Academy and I am so thankful for everything they have done for me,' he said. 'But the chance of coming to the biggest club in the world is something I just couldn't turn down. 'I'm excited about working with Jose Mourinho and learning everything I can from such a successful coach. 'I am looking forward to playing alongside the fantastic players in the squad.'",FALSE

Estadio Deportivo cite a report in Tuttomercatoweb which confirms the player's change of agent and that he has spoken to new Hammers sporting director Mario Husillos, formerly of Malaga. Los Rojiblancos paid ‚Ç¨13m to sign the Argentine from Sampdoria in the summer of 2016 and his market value has soared in the two years since, with any deal expected to be worth double that amount. Correa netted seven goals and provided seven assists last season at Sevilla.",FALSE
104,Arsenal boss Unai Emery makes massive offer to Real Madrid winger Lucas Vazquez,"Arsenal boss Unai Emery has made Lucas Vazquez one of his top targets and has already tabled a lucrative contract offer to prise him away from Real Madrid , according to reports. The 26-year-old winger is currently in Russia with the Spanish national team, and has enjoyed another solid season as a squad player for Real, contributing four goals and seven assists in La Liga from 16 starts. However, according to OKDIARIO , Emery believes Vazquez can become a star man in his own right and hopes to persuade him to leave the Bernabeu. The Gunners ‚Äì who have already been busy signing Stephan Lichtsteiner and Bernd Leno ‚Äì are ready to triple his salary and have put together a ¬£7m-a-year contract offer. Emery is convinced that Vazquez could be a real difference-maker in the Premier League and is ready to make a massive offer to Real Madrid to land him. However, Los Blancos are adamant that Vazquez is not available for transfer and do not want to weaken their squad in the same way they did last season, selling the likes of Alvaro Morata and James Rodriguez. He is contracted until 2021, and the Champions League holders will demand a massive fee even though Vazquez is largely a squad player. Both Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui are huge admirers of Vazquez's playing style and temperament, with the latter calling him up to the World Cup before being fired. He is considered a real unsung hero of Real's recent successes and is a good presence in the dressing room, which could make it very difficult for Emery to lure him to north London.",FALSE
105,Arsenal transfer news: Real Madrid star Lucas Vazquez 'offered triple-your-money deal',"Unai Emery has made Vazquez one of his leading transfer targets, according to OKDIARIO, and offered to triple the Spain international's current terms to move to the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal are rebuilding the squad left by Arsene Wenger for Emery and have been busy in the transfer market. Juventus right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner and Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno have already arrived. Deals are also in the pipeline for Borussia Dortmund centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira. But signing Vazquez from the Champions League winners would be a real statement of intent. The 26-year-old chipped in with eight goals and 16 assists last term and forced his way into new Real Madrid boss Julen Lopetegui's World Cup squad. Lopetegui was sensationally sacked by Spain on the eve of the tournament after his deal with Los Blancos came to light and replaced by Fernando Hierro. Vazquez has made two appearances at the World Cup for Spain, who have qualified from Group B to the last 16. According to OKDIARIO , Arsenal head coach Emery has set himself the target of signing Vazquez. The Spanish publication suggests Gunners bosses have offered Vazquez a deal worth ¬£7m (‚Ç¨8m) per season. But the Spanish giants are reportedly unwilling to sanction a sale and consider him non-transferable. Vazquez is currently under contract until the summer of 2021.",FALSE

Owner Abramovich has also had issues of his own with the Russian now in Israel, having failed to have his visa renewed. Despite that, however, Chelsea appear to be pressing ahead with their transfer plans. And Real Madrid ace Vazquez is supposedly interested in moving to Stamford Bridge. Abramovich has supposedly been directly in contact with the Spain international. And the Chelsea chief reportedly told him he would be guaranteed a starring role, such is the Blues' determination to sign him. At Real, Vazquez repeatedly faces a fight to break into Zinedine Zidane's starting line-up. The La Liga giants have plenty of options at their disposal when it comes to attackers. And although Cristiano Ronldo and Gareth Bale could both leave this summer, Don Balon say Vazquez is ready to do the same. The Chelsea target has also been linked to Liverpool in recent weeks. The Reds were supposedly keen on him to provide more competition for Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. However, Chelsea now appear likeliest to be his next destination.",FALSE

Manchester United have been heavily linked with a move for the 29-year-old this summer with reports indicating that long-term admirer Jose Mourinho would like a reunion with the Brazilian at Old Trafford. Other reports had suggested they could find themselves in a bidding war with Barcelona as the La Liga champions were understood to have made a ¬£50million offer for Willian. However, Sport claims that Barcelona have not made an offer for the Brazil international and although they are a fan of Willian, they will look to work with what they have in that position. CSKA Moscow's Aleksandr Golovin and Borussia Dortmund's Christian Pulisic are targets for Chelsea as they reportedly look to find a replacement for Willian. Liverpool are reportedly aiming to beat Arsenal to the signing of two Real Madrid stars this summer. The Reds have already announced the signings of Naby Keita and Fabinho as Jurgen Klopp looks to build a squad that is capable of competing for the Premier League title. Now, Spanish newspaper Marca are claiming that Klopp is plotting a double move for Real Madrid duo Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez. Barcelona-based paper Mundo Deportivo reported on Saturday that Liverpool had lodged a ‚Ç¨180m bid for the Spain star and that Real were studying the offer . After Spain's 2-2 draw with Morocco, he was asked about his future, which he replied: ""Liverpool? When the World Cup is over, we'll talk about that sort of thing, now I'm focused on selection. ""I'm glad Julen has signed up for Real Madrid, after the World Cup we'll talk things over with him."" Meanwhile, Marca are also linking Liverpool with a move for ‚Ç¨65m-rated Lucas Vazquez.

108,Real Madrid ace Lucas Vazquez wants Liverpool transfer but one thing may stop move - claim,"Real Madrid forward Vazquez could feature when the La Liga giants face Liverpool in the Champions League final this evening. However, talk is rife the Spain international may quit the Bernabeu at the end of the season. Vazquez has struggled for consistency at Real Madrid and, with Zinedine Zidane set to splash the cash this summer, may find game time tough to come by next term. And Spanish site Don Balon report the 26-year-old is keen to join Liverpool after the final in Kiev. It is said that Klopp's influence is key. Vazquez reportedly feels he would flourish under the Liverpool boss, despite facing a fight to get into the team. Klopp supposedly wants him to jostle with the likes of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah for a place in the team. Yet Don Balon say Liverpool fear being priced out of any potential transfer. Despite not always starting, Vazquez is a popular figure at Real having come through the club's academy. Real have always been protective of assets that have come from within. And, consequently, Liverpool may have to fork out a huge ¬£56million to get a deal done. Meanwhile, Vazquez has talked up the Reds ahead of the Champions League final tonight. ""I knew they would be able to hurt City in the quarter-final,"" he said. ""And that was how it was in both legs. They were the better team.""

Liverpool have been linked with Vazquez, who may leave Real Madrid having struggled for game time. And Spanish outlet Don Balon report the Spain international talked with Jurgen Klopp after the game. Klopp is eyeing more firepower for Liverpool next season. Mohamed Salah's injury stunted their momentum last night and, without him, the Liverpool attack lacked its usual stardust. Klopp is aware Liverpool need more if they are to challenge the likes of Real going forward. And Vazquez, Don Balon say, is on his radar. However, the 26-year-old supposedly told Klopp he has no desire to make the move to Merseyside. It is said he communicated to the Liverpool manager he intends to stay at Real and fight for his place. Meanwhile, speaking before the Real Madrid defeat, Liverpool chairman Tom Werner vowed to back Klopp. ""I am excited to see Naby Keita join the club this summer [from RB Leipzig] and I can only promise our supporters that we will continue to improve the squad,"" Werner told the Liverpool Echo.

Betis would also be in the race for the 23-year-old, but Vice-President Lorenzo Serra Ferrer is said to be prioritising a deal for ex-Newcastle United loanee Mikel Merino.

The Liverpool star is on Real's radar with the La Liga giants reportedly willing to pay whatever it takes to lure the player to the Bernabeu. Jurgen Klopp has always insisted the Egypt international will not be going anywhere. But that has not stopped Spanish outlet Don Balon from saying Salah wants out of Liverpool this summer. Any move is likely to be one of the biggest in football history. Liverpool coaxed ¬£142million out of Barcelona when they were pursuing Philippe Coutinho in January. And it is not unfeasible to think the Merseyside giants will demand more for Salah, who has struck 44 times this season. Don Balon say Salah is keen to join Real as he sees it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However, a major stumbling block is Los Blancos president Florentino Perez. Real are willing to pay ¬£131m to get a deal done - but Liverpool are demanding nearer ¬£175m to let their talisman go. Meanwhile, Zinedine Zidane has admitted he would not swap Salah for Cristiano Ronaldo despite the Liverpool star's terrific form. ""No, I have Cristiano and I talk about my players,"" he said. Zidane also insisted Liverpool would not be more up for the final than his own players. ""I am calm, not very nervous ‚Äì that's my character,"" he said.

Jose Mourinho has signed three players so far this summer but has admitted he's targeting at least two more arrivals , with a centre-back and a back-up forward his priorities.

Woodward is attracted by the commercial appeal of Bale, as well as his obvious ability on the pitch and would be willing to pay up to ¬£90m for the winger.

116,"Real Madrid transfer news: Man Utd still targeting Gareth Bale deal, Julen Lopetegui key","Real Madrid star Bale is top of Manchester United's list of transfer targets, with the Red Devils still hellbent on signing the 29-year-old. All the signs have been pointing to the player staying at the Bernabeu, particularly after Cristiano Ronaldo's sudden decision to join Juventus. Real Madrid are adamant Bale will be sticking with them in the post-Ronaldo era, but the player is yet to speak out over his future. Manchester United chief Ed Woodward has pursued Bale every summer since he succeeded David Gill in the role in 2013. And the Independent claim the Red Devils are still hoping to secure a deal for the Wales international. Bale put United on red alert in May when he said: ""I need to be playing week in week out and that hasn't happen this season for one reason or another. ""I need to sit down in the summer and discus it with my agent and go from there."" Express Sport understands Bale has since held talks with new boss Julen Lopetegui. And the Independent say that, if United want to sign their long-term target, they need Lopetegui to rubber-stamp a deal. The former Spain manager, who succeeded Zinedine Zidane before the World Cup, wants Bale to stay. But, should he change his mind, United could land their man. Bale may even force their hand if Real sign a Galactico this summer - with four players in the frame. PSG duo Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are both on their radar. And Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Harry Kane, of Chelsea and Tottenham, are also being tracked. United are reportedly willing to break the bank for Bale. But whether they will finally get their man remains to be seen.",FALSE
117,Gareth Bale set to stay at Real Madrid as Welshman prepares for pre-season return,"GARETH BALE is tipped to stay at Real Madrid as the Champions League hero returns to pre-season training. The Wales superstar publicly revealed he wants more regular starts after sinking Liverpool in the final as a two-goal super-sub . And Spanish sports newspaper AS say new chief Julen Lopetegui is keen to keep the long-time Manchester United target - especially after Real main man Cristiano Ronaldo agreed to join Juventus . Bale , 28, had an uneasy relationship with former boss Zinedine Zidane. But the Frenchman quit five days after winning the Champions League . And it seems ex-Spurs wideman Bale is now positive about his Real future. His agent Jonathan Barnett said last month: ""He wants a better year than he had last year. He wants to play more, and that's paramount to him."" But talks between Barnett and Bernabeu president Florentino Perez have been put on hold until Bale meets with Lopetegui to find out his plans. Lopetegui, 51, was sacked as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup - the day after it was announced he would take over Real on a three-year contract. And the former Porto boss is now fully focused on squad-building for what he calls his dream job. Injuries and a mixed reception from fans have beset Bale 's five years at Real. But Perez, as well as Lopetegui, are big believers in his talent - particularly, no doubt, after his stunning overhead goal against Liverpool in Ukraine.",FALSE
118,Chelsea transfer news: Blues make Anthony Martial decision on Eden Hazard replacement,"Maurizio Sarri is desperate to keep hold of Chelsea star Hazard, who has been a long-standing target for Real Madrid. Meanwhile Martial's future at Manchester United remains increasingly uncertain. Tottenham have been closely connected with the Frenchman, who struggled to curry favour under Jose Mourinho last term. Sunday Express Sport understands United are ready to trigger a clause in Martial's contract which could keep him at Old Trafford until 2020, as he is into the final year of his deal. However, the Blues appear to have other ideas. The Sunday Times claim Martial is wanted by the west London outfit as they seek to fill the void should Hazard leave. The report indicates that Bayern Munich are also interested in a transfer, but his supposed ¬£89.3million valuation would be prohibitive. Mourinho is eager to sign a winger, but the chances of either Ivan Perisic or Gareth Bale moving to United before the window closes on August 9 appear to be slim. Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, revealed last month his client wants to leave United. He said: ""After thinking about all the factors and possibilities, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. ""I think that when United, the most powerful club in the world, do not find an agreement after eight months of negotiations then they do not really want to keep such an important player in their squad. ""That's why this decision has come - it's a well-thought-out decision. ""Everyone will have their opinion but I think he needs to resume his career. The time has come.""",FALSE
119,Chelsea transfer news: Blues 'working to sign' ¬£89.3m-rated Man Utd star to replace Hazard,"Stamford Bridge bosses fancy Martial as a potential replacement for Real Madrid target Eden Hazard, according to The Sunday Times. It is claimed Hazard has asked to leave for Real Madrid, which has prompted Chelsea to scour the market. They are reportedly working to sign Manchester United outcast Martial but have baulked at his ¬£89.3m (‚Ç¨100m) price tag. Bayern Munich are also monitoring the France international but are reluctant to stump up the cash. Martial, who joined United from Monaco in 2015, has entered the final 12 months of his contract. Starsport understands Old Trafford chiefs are ready to trigger Martial's extension clause ‚Äì keeping him at the club until 2020. He fell out of favour under Jose Mourinho last term and his future has been the subject of much speculation. But Mourinho has indicated the 22-year-old will lead the line at the start of the new season, with Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford on extended breaks following the World Cup. The Sunday Times , however, claim the Red Devils boss is ready to sell Martial and replace him with a specialist winger. Martial would provide Chelsea with a Premier League-ready replacement for Hazard but the Belgian's departure would be a major setback for new head coach Maurizio Sarri. Hazard is reportedly eager to move to Real Madrid and has asked the Blues to accept an impending club-record fee for his services. He has also rejected offers from the club to extend his contract. Chelsea face a frantic final few weeks of the summer window but Sarri has claimed he is ""bored by the transfer market"". He said: ""I don't want to talk about it, I am not that interested in it. ""I think our task as managers is about growing the players we have."" Sarri added: ""At the end of the transfers it will be up to me to understand which type of game is the most suitable for the final squad. ""I cannot claim to come here to change 20 players, I must adapt to Chelsea and the players and then we will see if we change something in my game, because the squad is making me play a different game, because of their characteristics.""",FALSE
120,Man Utd set to trigger Anthony Martial contract extension clause amid exit rumours,"Martial looked to be heading out of United this summer after his agent revealed the striker's sense of disillusionment under Jose Mourinho. The striker struggled for game time following Alexis Sanchez's arrival at Old Trafford in January that ultimately led to him missing out on a place in France's World Cup-winning squad. That led to a growing belief that he would be on his way this summer, with Juventus and Tottenham having expressed interest in signing the 22-year-old, who signed from Monaco for ¬£36million in 2015. However, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is ready to trigger the extension clause with United determined not to offload him. Martial is set to lead United's attack at the start of the new season, with Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford on extended breaks following the World Cup. And United team-mate Ander Herrera believes Martial, who impressed in United's 1-1 draw with Club America on the opening game of their US tour in Phoenix, has the ability to become one of the world's elite players. ""He's very talented,"" said Herrera. ""He can be one of the best players in the world and I think he's very, very focused this season to smash it. ""When you have players like Anthony, like Rashford, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Alexis Sanchez, those kind of players that can change the game. If one of them can't play we have three or four more, so we have lots of options. ""We shouldn't think any other club has better players, because we have at least as good as our opponents. Now it's all about work, confidence, about keeping on playing like he did in the game (against Club America). ""I'm confident with them because they're all amazing players and Anthony looks very sharp."" Herrera's team-mate and Spanish compatriot Juan Mata endorsed his high praise of the club's youngsters, with Tahith Chong, Angel Gomes, Joel Pereira, Axel Tuanzebe, Tim Fosu-Mensah, Scott McTominay, Demi Mitchell, Andreas Pereira and 16-year-old Mason Greenwood all involved in the 1-1 draw with Club America in Phoenix. They are also likely to feature in tonight's second game of the US tour, against MLS side San Jose Earthquakes at the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. Mata said: ""It's good news for the club and especially the Academy that we have so many kids with us. ""They're having a great experience by training with us and the manager, seeing what United represents around the world, and the future is bright for Manchester United with these Academy players.""",TRUE

Representatives from both parties are reported to have met in London to discuss a potential deal, with the La Liga side opting for a loan move. However, Chelsea would prefer to sell the newly-crowned World Cup winner outright for the right price. While Giroud is Atletico's wishlist, the possibility of a transfer for Kalinic is still a priority and it's not currently know if the club would be open to signing both players.

Diego Simeone's side were looking to sign Nikola Kalinic from AC Milan but it seems the deal has fallen through as the Italian club are taking too long. Which means Atletico have started to look elsewhere and set their eyes on Giroud. However Giroud has only been at Chelsea since January and it's not yet known if Maurizio Sarri will be willing to let him go. Italian journalist Gianluca di Marzio claims that Chelsea would consider doing a deal if the loan move came with an obligation to buy, rather than an option. The 31-year-old completed his move to Stamford Bridge this year on an 18-month deal for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around ¬£18m. Giroud scored five times in 18 appearances for the Blues last season. The forward is a World Cup winner this summer after France won the 2018 tournament. Despite not scoring or having a shot on target in Russia, Giroud has said that winning it for France is the best thing to happen to him. Chelsea are currently on their pre-season tour in Australia to play Perth Glory, before matches in Nice, Dublin and at Stamford Bridge in the International Champions Cup.

Tottenham are known to be fans but Chelsea would likely be able to offer more cash than their London rivals. Lascelles could also leave Newcastle as he looks to make a step up in his career with Bailey and Seri have both been heavily linked with moves to England in recent months. Chelsea had a mixed campaign last season off the back of winning the Premier League title the year before.

Cillessen has a ¬£53m buyout clause in his contract, but Barcelona could sell for much less this summer.

Kovacic is under contract at the Bernabeu until 2021 and is protected by a ‚Ç¨300million (¬£264m) release clause. Given such a high buy-out fee and Madrid's desire to keep the 24-year-old, who is valuable back-up in a number of roles, United face a fight to sign him. The Mail say that English champions Manchester City and Italian giants Juventus and Roma have also looked at Kovacic - who has come off the bench twice for Croatia at the World Cup in wins over Nigeria and Argentina. But it is thought that Kovacic is only seen as an alternative to Jorginho for City, who have been locked in lengthy negotiations to sign the Napoli man for a suspected ¬£43m. United have already signed Fred in midfield but Marouane Fellaini is expected to leave Old Trafford despite Jose Mourinho's desire to keep him on board, which opens up an extra spot alongside the likes of Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic. Marca claim that Madrid president Florentino Perez will not sanction an exit for Kovacic because of his high ceiling. Perez reportedly hopes that Julen Lopetegui can offer the former Inter Milan ace a more important role, particularly with Modric - at 32 - entering the twilight of his career, to sway him to change his mind and see out his potential in the capital of Spain. The Mail also say that United are keen to recruit Willian from Chelsea while they will have to fend off interest from Juve for want-away winger Anthony Martial. The Frenchman, an absentee from his country's World Cup squad, has declared through his agent that he wants to leave the Red Devils for more game time. But United are determined to hold on to the former Monaco starlet unless he pushes for an exit and an interested club make a significant offer for his services.",FALSE

But a deal for Nabil Fekir fell through at the last moment because of an issue with the medical. Karius made a mistake in a pre-season friendly against Tranmere earlier this week but Klopp defended the German ace.

Our job is to perform and you do what you do and that is part of the deal. ""You (the media) can all stop it immediately - promise? You never ask again, that would be one little step.

And it has been revealed meetings will take place next week in order to discuss where Cillessen's future lies beyond the summer. Barcelona are said to be eager to keep hold of Cillessen, who's seen as the ideal deputy to current No 1 Marc-Andre Ter Stegen. But they will not stand in his way if he makes it clear he wants to call time on his spell in Ter Stegen's shadow.

Chelsea, who are facing losing Thibaut Courtois, will also be in pursuit of the former Ajax star's signature too. Barcelona would like to tie up a deal for Cillessen as quickly as possible if required so they can snap up a replacement. Barcelona had to wait until the final week of the transfer window in 2016 to buy Cillessen after Claudio Bravo left for Manchester City.

But the Merseyside club look to have been priced out of an approach for either of the pair, who would cost in excess of ¬£80million such is their pedigree and importance to their current clubs. Alisson is also thought to be attracting interest from Real Madrid, further complicating Liverpool's hopes of landing the Brazil keeper who is currently his country's first choice in Russia. Cillessen had therefore been touted as a possible alternative but the Times have ruled out the Dutchman, although he has done an impressive job whenever he has filled in for Marc-Andre ter Stegen at the Nou Camp. The Dutchman, formerly of Ajax, has played just 21 times for Barca in two years but kept 11 clean sheets and at 29, around about the peak age for a keeper, it is likely he would jump at the opportunity to move elsewhere for greater opportunities. Cillessen is thought to have a ‚Ç¨60million (¬£52m) release clause, however, with his deal in Catalonia running until 2021. The Liverpool Echo have also ruled out Lazio's Thomas Strakosha and Nick Pope of Burnley although Jack Butland, Jiri Pavlenka and Yann Sommer have all been linked with Karius' future unknown and Simon Mignolet expected to move on.

Everton ended last season with a goal difference of -14 as Sam Allardyce guided the club to safety before being sacked. Strengthening the defence is a priority for Silva and a loan move for the defender could be a more realistic proposition.

Speculation regarding United's interest in Arnautovic swelled after Jose Mourinho was spotted watching Austria's international friendly against Russia last month. Asked about the Portuguese tactician's presence at the game, he said: 'He was on holiday, he told you. I haven't spoken to him. He was on holiday.' He added: 'It's nice to hear [of interest], I haven't heard anything from my brother, my agent. You can keep asking this question but you'll never hear the answer from me.' Mourinho already has a surplus of forwards at his disposal, with Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Alexis Sanchez all competing for places. Upon the arrival of Sanchez last January Mourinho admitted he would look to improve other areas of the team in future transfer windows. Brazil international midfielder Fred is set to be the club's first addition of the summer, while 19-year-old full-back Diogo Dalot is likely to join from FC Porto. Arnautovic meanwhile is braced to start working under the third different manager of his short spell in East London, after Manuel Pellegrini was appointed to replace David Moyes in May.",TRUE

173,Man Utd transfer news: Real Madrid tell Jose Mourinho how he can seal Gareth Bale deal,"Manchester United are ready to exploit Bale's situation amid uncertainty over his Real Madrid future. The Wales superstar scored twice as the La Liga giants beat Liverpool 3-1 to win the Champions League on Saturday. However, that looks to be a parting gift amid reports he wants a move to Manchester United . Speaking after his Liverpool heroics, the 28-year-old said: ""Obviously I need to play. ""That hasn't happened this season for one reason or another. I was injured for five or six games and I've been fit ever since. ""I'll have to sit down in the summer, discuss it with my agent and take it from there."" And the Manchester Evening News say Real have offered United encouragement. It is said they are willing to let the former Tottenham star depart - if they receive a suitable offer. Previously, Real have thwarted United's attempts to sign their wing wizard. But it appears they are now more happy to do a deal - despite Bale's Champions League heroics. Meanwhile, Sky Sports' La Liga expert Guillem Balague thinks Bale will only leave Real if they refuse to give him the same guarantees as United. ""It's so out of character what he did and in a way say, 'How about me? Why don't I play more often? We should talk',"" Balague told his official YouTube channel. ""It's going to be a talk between Jonathan Barnett, the agent of Gareth Bale, and Real Madrid. It won't happen next week as I believe Barnett is away on business but it will happen after that. ""The message so far that Real Madrid are sending to them is very clear, that he's not for sale. ""Imagine the possibility of the hero of Kiev ending up with Manchester United's shirt in a couple of months. It makes no sense. ""It makes no sense to get rid of someone who is peaking, at 28, and just after such a success. ""He hasn't got the confidence of Zidane, there's no doubt about that. Zidane will have to change - how do you convince him? Generally, on the training pitch. ""But he needs to make a leap of faith and give Bale the confidence that he needs to be the player he can be or that he is, but hasn't been able to show this season. ""He disappeared against PSG, Juventus, Bayern Munich and against Liverpool in the final which suggested the confidence of Zidane isn't there. But not just that, if Bale wants to play - he wants to be important to the side. ""To do that, you have to give him the confidence. If in those meetings the answer is, 'Sorry we cannot guarantee that' then Barnett and Bale will basically have to say, 'Well I don't want to stay here.' ""So far Real Madrid are saying they're not selling. He doesn't want to leave. It's not his first choice. ""He wants to stay at Real Madrid and show how good he is but if he's not given that opportunity, then he will move. There's a lot of possibilities on the table.""",FALSE
174,Liverpool turn to Barcelona goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen after Jan Oblak and Alisson setbacks,"Liverpool have added Barcelona goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen to their shortlist of players who could replace Loris Karius between the sticks this summer, according to reports. The Merseysiders completed a ¬£44m deal for Monaco midfielder Fabinho on Monday in what promises to be another ambitious window for the Reds, though their real priority is a goalkeeper. Current No.1 Karius made two mistakes in last Saturday's Champions League final as Real Madrid sealed a 3-1 victory in Kiev, practically rolling the ball to Karim Benzema for Real's opener. His night got even worse when he palmed Gareth Bale 's long range effort into his own net, and the German's hapless display has underlined Liverpool's need for a new goalkeeper. Prior to the Champions League final, manager Jurgen Klopp had been prepared to stick by Karius unless one of his top targets ‚Äì Jan Oblak or Alisson ‚Äì became available, but that stance has changed. Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo report that Liverpool are now considering signing Barca keeper Cillessen if Oblak or Alisson cannot be prised away from Atletico Madrid and Roma respectively. The Dutch keeper has played understudy to No.1 Marc-Andre Ter Stegen since moving to Camp Nou but wants to play more and is ready to push for a move to get more game time. Both the player and Barcelona have been alerted to Liverpool's interest, and the Catalan club are worried his ¬£52.5m buyout clause could prove more attractive than the fees being demanded by Roma and Atletico. Both sides will hold out for record fees for their shot-stoppers, with Roma not willing to accept anything less than ¬£80m for Alisson and Atletico keen to increase Oblak's release clause to ¬£175m.",FALSE

Liverpool have tested the water to see if the 29-year-old would be interested in a move to Merseyside. Cillessen has spent the vast majority of his time at Barca merely warming the bench as back up to Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Klopp is hoping that the opportunity to be undisputed No.1 as a club like Liverpool would be too tempting to turn down. And according to Mundo Deportivo, the former Ajax star is ready to 'analyse' the Reds' offer as he considers his Camp Nou future. The report does not give any details of the Anfield outfit's supposed offer, however. Despite making just two La Liga starts in two seasons, Mundo Deportivo state that Cillessen is likely to want to stay and fight for his place. Klopp has given Loris Karius a couple of preseason runouts hoping that he had put his Champions League nightmare behind him. But he made another howler in the 3-2 win over Tranmere Rovers last week. And Karius faced persistent jeering from the Bury fans during Liverpool 's third pre-season game on Saturday. ""Loris conceded that goal, but we cannot create a story after every mistake,"" Klopp said after the Tranmere game. ""Mistakes will happen, I don't like it ‚Äì he doesn't like it, but it will happen.

Mourinho does not want it taken out of the kitty for other players he is more interested in than Bale . The Old Trafford boss is in no mood to be mucked about over deals for long-term targets Fred and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic.

The club are so far yet to make a bid for Lazio's Milinkovic-Savic, 23. Because, while Mourinho rates the player highly, he does not think the striker is worth the ¬£87.5m the Italians want. However, the Serbian international is all but certain to be on the move in the summer after Lazio lost out to Inter Milan in the race for Serie A's final Champions League place. United risk seeing him sign for rival suitors like Juventus or even Manchester City if they refuse to meet the asking price. Meanwhile Red Devils striker Romelu Lukaku is refusing to back Mourinho's version of why he did not start the FA Cup final.

Spurs can extend Alderweireld's contract by 12 months but it means he will have a release clause of ¬£25million, which is attainable for most top sides. As a result, Spurs are demanding around ¬£50m for the defender in a bid to get the best price for him. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho wants at least two more signings before the transfer window closes on August 9 and bolstering his centre-back options is one of his key priorities.

According to the Daily Mirror, Leicester have identified Ben Gibson as Maguire's replacement. Middlesbrough centre-back Gibson was on Leicester's radar last summer, but they refused to sell. The Foxes made a ¬£13million bid, but they were snubbed, however the Mirror suggests they are ready to revive their interest in Gibson.

However, Jose Mourinho has revealed the club will not sell until they receive a respectable offer. With Antonio Valencia injured with a torn calf that could rule him out of their opening Premier League match, Mourinho could be left short of full-back options. ""Matteo wants to leave and I think when a player wants to leave, if the right offer arrives, you have to try to be human and let the player follow his instinct,"" said Mourinho.

And Spanish outlet Don Balon say the Reds have now had a bid accepted by Barcelona. Liverpool know more is required if they are to challenge for the Premier League title next term. The Merseyside giants came agonisingly close to winning the Champions League on Saturday. However, Mohamed Salah's injury in that game meant Real Madrid took the trophy via a 3-1 win in Kiev. Liverpool want another forward to ease the burden on Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane next term. And Don Balon say Barcelona have now agreed to sell Dembele after just one solitary season. The report fails to mention a fee but says Liverpool have agreed to pay Barcelona close to the ¬£134m they spent last year. Dembele is reportedly willing to fight for his Barca future. But it appears Nou Camp chief Josep Maria Bartomeu has other ideas and a move to Liverpool now beckons. Speaking just earlier this month, Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde insisted Dembele was part of his plans. ""We have to realise he just got here. He's had some injuries and getting playing time in our team is not easy,"" he said. ""He's an incredible talent, technically outstanding, he's quick, a difference-maker. ""Maybe he needs to work on defence a little bit and some other areas. Maybe putting on pressure after we lose the ball. ""But we know he's young, he's had a tough season and we hope he will continue to develop next year.""",FALSE
189,Ousmane Dembele to Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp 'makes transfer decision' after ranking squad,"The France international has been linked with a move to Liverpool in the past few months. Last summer, the forward joined Barcelona for a mammoth ¬£142m from Borussia Dortmund - making him the second-most expensive player in the world at the time. But he has suffered at the Catalan club in his first year after injuries struck. He has left him scrambling to make the starting XI under Ernesto Valverde and their latest transfer plans have reportedly left him furious. Malcom signed for the Spanish champions this week who plays in the same position as Dembele. And the Frenchman is not happy, with a departure possibly on the cards. The Reds have been touted as a possible destination, with Klopp a known fan of the 21-year-old. But the Liverpool Echo have reported that this is not the case this summer, with the German boss happy with his attacking options. ""I can't see it,"" Liverpool Echo reporter James Pearce said when asked about the Reds potentially going for Dembele. ""Klopp seems happy with his attacking options as it stands.""",FALSE
190,Barcelona transfer news: Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to overlook Ousmane Dembele,"Barcelona star Dembele has been linked with Liverpool over the last few months amid uncertainty over his long-term future. The France international, who featured as his country stunned the likes of Uruguay, Argentina and Croatia to win the World Cup in Russia, struggled for the Catalan giants last season. Barcelona signed Dembele as a ¬£134million replacement for Neymar but talk of a move to Liverpool has since arisen. Arsenal also have an interest in the 21-year-old. But Liverpool Echo journalist James Pearce claims that, even though Barcelona have signed Malcom from Bordeaux, the Reds have no plans to sign Dembele. ""I can't see it,"" he said when asked about Liverpool potentially going for Dembele. ""Klopp seems happy with his attacking options as it stands."" Liverpool have strengthened their attack despite missing out on Lyon hotshot Nabil Fekir. The Reds tied up a ¬£12million deal for Xherdan Shaqiri, who arrived from Stoke after their relegation to the Championship. Talk of a move for Fekir has, however, rumbled on. And Liverpool Echo journalist Pearce has explained why Liverpool are also unlikely to sign the Lyon star. He added: ""Transfers always create such a buzz and some fans will always want more. No sooner had Liverpool made Alisson the most expensive goalkeeper ever, the talk was all about who was coming in next. ""Talk about Fekir has rumbled on all summer and I think because Liverpool came so close to signing him, many are desperate for it to happen. ""The bottom line is you can't commit to that kind of fee and big wages over five years if you are worried he's going to break down. ""I do understand it when people talk about how Liverpool still need a Coutinho replacement. Fekir would have been that man and the Reds haven't targeted a similar alternative. ""But Klopp has added to the squad's creative qualities with the signings of Keita and Shaqiri and seems content with the options at his disposal.""",TRUE
191,Barcelona transfer news: Arsenal favourites to sign Ousmane Dembele after Liverpool twist,"Barcelona star Dembele is ready to excite Arsenal and Liverpool fans by pressing for a Nou Camp exit this summer. Reports have claimed the France international, seething at Barca's decision to sign Malcom from Bordeaux, is keen to leave the club in pursuit of regular, first-team football. Arsenal want a winger with Dembele on a list of targets Unai Emery would love to sign. Liverpool have also been linked but, in a sensational twist, Jurgen Klopp has supposedly decided not to pursue the 21-year-old.

Arsenal are priced at 2/1 to seal the signing of the wing wizard, with Liverpool available at 6/1. Chelsea have then been made 8/1 outsiders to land Dembele, with Tottenham and PSG at 10/1 and 12/1 respectively. Coral have then slapped 16/1 and 20/1 odds on Manchester United and Manchester City to sign the Barcelona star. ""We have seen a flurry of bets this afternoon for Arsenal to beat off competition from their Premier League rivals for the services of Ousmane Dembele and as a result the Gunners are now the favourites to sign the Frenchman,"" said Coral's John Hill. Last week, Football London journalist Charles Watts said Emery wanted Dembele over Bayern Munich's Kingsley Coman. He said: ""Kingsley Coman is a player most sides in Europe would be looking at if he we available - and Arsenal are no different. ""He plays in an area that Emery would ideally like to strengthen, although I still believe Ousmane Dembele is the wide attacker that the club really want. ""Getting Dembele out of Barcelona though looks very unlikely, unless they agree to a loan, so Coman would certainly be a player of interest at the Emirates."" Dembele netted just four goals from 23 outings for Barcelona last season.",FALSE

Klopp may be working on convincing Dembele to quit the La Liga champions, but Bartomeu insists the Frenchman is going nowhere this summer.

He's been demonstrating during the season that he's a good young player for us. 'But, of course, next season will be different. It's not easy to play in Barcelona the first year because the model of football is quite different from the rest. 'But after one year I'm sure we are going to see Dembele and Coutinho at a very high level.' Liverpool sold Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona in January, but the attacker had to watch from a distance as his former side made it all the way to the Champions League final. Coutinho would have collected a winners medal should Liverpool have beaten Real Madrid having been an integral player during the Reds' group stage campaign. Dembele and Coutinho did not enjoy the electric start to life at the Nou Camp fans were hoping for, but showed glimpses of their talent.

""It's player power now,"" Gascoigne told BetStars . ""If the money is right and Tottenham want to sell him, they will do.

Chelsea have received a boost in their battle to retain Eden Hazard following Zinedine Zidane's resignation as Real Madrid manager. Zidane stunned the Champions League winners when announcing his Bernabeu departure. Hazard had been the club's priority signing, however it was Zidane pushing for the Belgian's signature. And now according to the London Evening Standard, Zidane's departure means Los Blancos will now chase other targets instead.

Serie A interest in Dembele ""I have two years left on my contract. I don't know what is going to happen."" Alderweireld is currently away with Belgium at the World Cup and will face some of his Tottenham team-mates when Belgium and England meet in their final Group G game. While Belgium are among the favourites to win the World Cup, Alderweireld also thinks England are going to enjoy a ""very good"" tournament. ""I have been in the Premier League for four years and something is different with England now,"" he said. Spurs consider Grealish move ""They are young lads, there is a lot of desire. There is a new vibe coming. They have wonderful players, not just stars but players who want to become better. ""I think they are going to have a very good World Cup. England can do whatever they want if they are on it. They are a very good team. ""I know most of the players. They have the right mentality to go far now. They have quality and desire, players with a good attitude.""",TRUE
216,Man Utd look to take advantage of Spurs' stance on transfers with early Toby Alderweireld approach,"M anchester United are hoping to take advantage of Mauricio Pochettino's desire for Tottenham Hotspur to wrap up their transfer business early in their pursuit of Belgium defender Toby Alderweireld. Jose Mourinho, who is also pursuing a deal for Shakhtar Donetsk and Brazil midfielder Fred, wants to sign a centre-half this summer as the United manager bids to strengthen his defence and believes Alderweireld would be a good fit. Negotiating with Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman , has long proven a taxing experience for United and a formal move for the ¬£50 million plus rated Alderweireld could still be fraught with complications. But Pochettino has made it clear to Levy, both publicly and in talks with the Spurs chairman, that he wants the club to conduct their business earlier than in previous summers, both in terms of ins and outs, and United hope that stance could assist any approach for Alderweireld. Spurs have traditionally left business late but, with a shortened transfer window compounded by the World Cup finals , which will further limit time to do deals, Pochettino hopes the club do not drag their heels and wants the go-ahead to sell anybody he believes he can replace. Levy is eager for Pochettino to sign a new contract and knows he may have to bow to some of the manager's wishes. I t would still take a huge offer to persuade Levy to sell Alderweireld to a direct English rival for the Champions League places. Alderweireld would be available for ¬£25m next summer [2019] under the terms of his contract, which has two years to run, but Spurs want more than double that this summer. There have even been reports that Levy could hold out for a fee closer to the ¬£75m Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January , although such a price seems excessive given Alderweireld's age and contractual situation. S till, it remains to be seen if Ed Woodward, the United executive vice-chairman, is prepared to go the extra yard to secure the services of Alderweireld, who, at 29, would have little resale value and likely be bought with immediate success in mind. W oodward was unwilling to meet Inter Milan's ¬£49m asking price for Croatia winger Ivan Perisic last summer, much to Mourinho's frustration, because it was considered an excessive sum for a player who was 28 at the time. Woodward was also conscious that United ‚Äì who have also been linked with Spurs left back Danny Rose - paid Chelsea a projected ¬£40m fee for the 29-year-old Serbia midfielder, Nemanja Matic, that summer. Pochettino is a keen admirer of Anthony Martial but United are opposed to selling the France forward, who has also attracted interest from Chelsea , to an English club. If Tottenham insisted on taking Martial as part of any negotiations over Alderweireld, a deal for the defender could easily break down and force United to pursue other central defensive targets. The sale of Martial to any club, let alone an English rival, would be dimly received by United supporters, though. He has endured an up and down season in which he has struggled to hold down a regular starting place, failing to make France's World Cup squad in the process, and he is one of several players who has a difficult relationship with Mourinho. But his talent is considerable and there are plenty of people within Old Trafford who feel the club would be making a huge mistake that could come back to haunt them if Martial was sold. W ith Michael Carrick retiring, a midfielder remains Mourinho's first priority and the Portuguese is hoping to land Fred, whom Manchester City have also pursued previously, before the start of the World Cup finals next month.",FALSE
217,Manchester United transfer move for Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld takes major twist,"Manchester United 's summer move for Toby Alderweireld has taken a major twist, with club scouts reportedly expressing concerns over the Tottenham defender. Alderweireld is considered one of the best defenders in the Premier League and has been a mainstay in Spurs' team since signing from Atletico Madrid in the summer of 2015. Despite impressing in north London, the 29-year-old looks set to leave this summer after failing to strike an agreement with the club over a new contract. The Belgian defender has fallen out of favour with manager Mauricio Pochettino and has been heavily linked with a move to Premier League rivals United. Jose Mourinho is keen to bolster his defensive options this summer and the club agreed a deal for young Portuguese full-back Diogo Dalot last week. Alderweireld emerged as another top target for Mourinho but the Manchester Evening News say United's interest has dropped off in recent days. It is claimed club scouts have expressed concerns about the Belgium international and are now looking further afield as they bid to bring a top defender to Old Trafford. Raphael Varane, Jerome Boateng, Kalidou Koulibaly, Milan Skriniar, Alessio Romagnoli, Jose Gimenez and Caglar Soyuncu are all said to be on United's radar. If United sign a centre-back during the summer transfer window, at least one of their current centre-halves ‚Äì Eric Bailly, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Victor Lindelof and Marcos Rojo ‚Äì will likely leave.",FALSE

That is the date the France international's release clause will drop to ¬£87.5m (‚Ç¨100m) - a bargain for a top striker in the current transfer market. Barcelona were believed to have fended off Manchester United and Real Madrid to stand at the front of the queue for Griezmann once his clause drops. But in a shock twist, it appears as though the striker will not be heading to Catalonia. According to Spanish newspaper ABC , Griezmann has told close friends he will be remaining in Madrid for next season. The revelation comes almost a year since he flirted with a move to Manchester United, telling a French TV station his chances of heading to Old Trafford were ""six out of 10"". The twist is a major boost for Atletico, who will hope to challenge Barcelona and Real Madrid for the La Liga title next season. However, it is a bitter blow for Barcelona's top brass, who have been working on a deal for Griezmann since January, it has been claimed. Asked about his future over the weekend, Griezmann told TF1: ""My future? It'll be determined before the World Cup. ""The most important thing is that I'm feeling happy. ""I feel fine, I have total confidence. ""We [France] must keep our feet on the ground and do everything possible to succeed at the World Cup."" Instead of joining Barca, he will sign a bumper new contract at Atletico that will see him become one of Europe's highest-paid footballers. The fresh terms will also dramatically raise Griezmann's release clause to all-but confirm his long-term future at the Wanda Metropolitano.",TRUE
219,Manchester United 'considering ¬£31m bid for Sevilla star Clement Lenglet' to boost defensive options,"MANCHESTER UNITED have contacted Sevilla for Clement Lenglet, according to reports. The centre-back is regarded as one of the best young defenders in Europe and United are keen to bag him this summer, say L'Equipe . United had a proper look at the 22-year-old Frenchman when he starred for the La Liga outfit as they beat Jose Mourinho's side in the Champions League knockout stages. Despite conceding just one more league goal than Manchester City, Mourinho wants another central defender at Old Trafford next season. The United chief already has Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Eric Bailly, Victor Lindelof and Marcos Rojo as central defensive options.

220,Manchester United make concrete approach to sign ¬£31m Sevilla defender Clement Lenglet ahead of Barcelona,"Manchester United have made a concrete approach to sign Sevilla centre-back Clement Lenglet, according to reports in France. Jose Mourinho is in the market for a new central defender but United have suffered setbacks in their efforts to sign Samuel Umtiti, who recently signed a new contract with Barcelona, and Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who is on the verge of joining Arsenal . Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld has also been targeted but reports this week have claimed that United and Spurs have not held talks regarding a potential deal. According to L'Equipe , United have stepped up their efforts to sign Lenglet from Sevilla. The report claims that United were particularly impressed by the 22-year-old's performances against Romelu Lukaku in the Champions League knockout stages. Sevilla dumped United out at the last-16 stage after a surprise win at Old Trafford, while Mourinho claimed after the game that 'many' players from the Spanish side would improve his team. Lenglet was signed by Sevilla for ‚Ç¨5 million in January 2017 and the Frenchman has also attracted interest from Barcelona this summer. The centre-back has a ‚Ç¨35m (¬£30.7m) release clause in his deal with Sevilla and recent reports in Spain have claimed that Barcelona are close to completing a deal.",FALSE
221,Barcelona transfer news: Catalans hand Man Utd blow by nearing Clement Lenglet deal,"The Independent claim that the French centre-back, who has also been of interest to Manchester United, is set to seal a ¬£35million move to the La Liga champions. The two clubs have yet to completely agree over a deal with Barca looking to pay for Lenglet in instalments, while the Andalusian outfit are looking for his entire release clause in full. Lenglet's reputation has soared over the past 12 months following his first full season with Sevilla, having joined from Nancy in January 2017. He made 54 appearances in all competitions, scoring four goals, as Sevilla reached the Champions League quarter-finals - beating Man United along the way - and lost in the Copa del Rey final to Barca as well as finishing 7th in the league. The 23-year-old is thought to have agreed terms over a contract with the Catalan giants - who look likely to have to pay a lump sum for the player to avoid negotiations dragging on. Lenglet missed out on France's World Cup squad but has played at every level from under-16 to under-21 and is expected to force himself into the reckoning alongside Barca starter Samuel Umtiti in the years to come. Lenglet had also been identified as one of several potential targets by Jose Mourinho at United, the player's agent Gregory Dakad having told ESPN FC in June that his client had ""offers from clubs in various countries."" But recent reports in Spain revealed that Lenglet has rejected a new contract with Sevilla in order to move to Barcelona and become Ernesto Valverde's first signing of the summer. The Independent say that Lenglet will be the long-term replacement for former Arsenal man Thomas Vermaelen, while fellow centre-half Yerry Mina's future is uncertain. The Colombian scored three goals in three games for his country at the World Cup, including an injury-time equaliser against England - before a penalty shoot-out defeat - on Tuesday night. The towering defender has been linked with Everton, who have conducted talks with Barca - who apparently want to send him out on loan as opposed to selling him, unless they can work in a buy-back clause.",TRUE

223,Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp targeting Atletico Madrid star Jan Oblak in record deal to replace Loris Karius,"Liverpool will make a world-record bid for Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Jan Oblak this summer, according to reports. Jurgen Klopp was targeting a new No.1 long before current keeper Loris Karius made two calamitous mistakes in the Champions League Final. Despite obtaining an apparent concussion in a clash with Real Madrid skipper Sergio Ramos, the German is not the world-class glovesman Klopp wants in order to challenge for major silverware. According to Spanish publication Don Balon, the Reds will test Atletico¬ís resolve for Oblak with a world-record ¬£79 million bid. The Slovenian has an ¬£87 million release clause in his contract, but the report claims Liverpool are confident they will accept a slightly lower offer.

Oblak has been in incredible form following his arrival as Thibaut Courtois' replacement in the Spanish capital four years ago.

But it's since he moved to Besiktas on a two-year loan in 2016 that he's really made a name for himself, scoring 37 goals in 78 appearances. Talisca's performances at the Vodafone Park have turned heads across Europe with a Premier League switch widely touted.

Well they do still have an option to sign Talisca for ‚Ç¨18m and they are considering the possibility of signing him and selling him on for a profit but we are a long way from that as things stand,"" he added. United boss Jose Mourinho hinted in 2014 that he was in for Talisca while he was in charge of Chelsea. ""I think Benfica hired well,"" said Mourinho.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will look to take advantage of the cash-strapped Championship side with a bid for the midfielder way below Villa's ¬£40million valuation. The Telegraph reckon Mauricio Pochettino has identified the Birmingham-born schemer as one of his main summer targets, and wants a deal wrapped up quickly. Failure to get back to the Premier League last month has left Villa in a perilous financial position, leaving them with little choice but to cash in on the 22-year-old. Levy wants Grealish for less than ¬£20m, and with the West Midlands side surviving administration after settling their tax bill with the HMRC, Spurs know Villa are not in a position of strength. However, with Manchester United and Leicester City showing interest, owner Dr Tony Xia will hope to spark a bidding war to achieve their valuation for the former England Under-21 star. SIGN UP FOR DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP NOW Despite coming through the ranks and being a boyhood Villa fan, Grealish would find working under a boss with the reputation of developing young players like Pochettino exciting.

The North Londoner's are also tracking Crystal Palace attacker Wilfried Zaha. But they could end their interest after being quoted ¬£70m for the Ivory Coast star. Another stumbling block would have been Zaha'a wages as he would expect a pay-hike on his current ¬£110,000-a-week pay.

The last time they did was when they signed Dele Alli from League One MK Dons in 2015, and that was the first time in six years, since a double deal for Sheffield United pair Kyle Naughton and Kyle Walker in 2009. Sky Sports News understands Grealish was not among their original list of transfer targets , so why have they decided to move for the England U21 international? With the help of David Webb - a football transfer consultant and former head of elite potential identification at Tottenham - we attempt to answer that question‚Ä¶ ""The Championship has improved him on and off the pitch"" Statistically, Grealish has been one of the standout performers in the Championship this season and received glowing reviews from fans of both his and opposing clubs. He scored three goals, bagged six assists and made 59 key passes - more than another Tottenham target in Ryan Sessegnon - as Villa made the play-offs but lost in the final to Fulham. Grealish was outstanding at Wembley, showing what he can do on the big stage, but a deeper look at his statistics throughout the Championship last season show why he is so coveted. Having missed the first half of the season due to a career-threatening kidney injury, Grealish helped Villa turn their season around in the new year. Villa won 58 per cent of games with Grealish starting, and 48 per cent without, with a man-of-the-match performance against Birmingham and match-winning stunner against Cardiff the standout moments. His pass completion rate of 83.7 per cent in the opposition half was among the best in the division, but Grealish's strength also lies in his ability to draw the foul. He won 3.37 per game last season, more than any other Championship player, and with Christian Eriksen's deadly delivery key to Spurs' success, the Premier League side will have surely seen this as an advantage. Sky Sports News understands Spurs have been one of a number of top clubs who have scouted him during his impressive campaign along with Manchester United and Arsenal, while Chelsea, Fulham and Leicester are also keen. Webb says he has been on top clubs' radars since he broke into Villa's first team while they were still in the Premier League in 2014. ""Watching him when he was younger, his ability was never in question,"" Webb told Sky Sports . ""When I first started at Tottenham in 2015, Grealish was breaking into the first-team at Villa. He was fluctuating between the U23s and the first team. Watching him in the U23 games, it was far too easy for him at that level. ""He wasn't ready for the first team but, because of his talent and the way he played with his quality on and off the ball, he looked like he needed guiding before he could make that next step. I would have recommended him based on his ability but, a few years ago you wouldn't have put him into an environment like Tottenham. ""If you're a Tottenham, you're looking at the season he's had and the strides he's made with his character, looking at his improvements on and off the field. His talent is coming to fruition. ""I'd be amazed that big clubs, with the due diligence they do, would go for him but with the season he has had and the steps he's made off the field, he is ready for a higher level. He's been a difference-maker on the pitch for Villa this season, and he has needed time in the Championship for his development."" In 2015, after helping Villa to an FA Cup final and survival in the Premier League, Grealish was pictured slumped in the street during a holiday in Tenerife. But in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports before the play-off final, Grealish insisted he had grown up as a player and a person. ""As a footballer, there is so much spare time,"" Grealish said. ""When I was younger I was probably doing stuff I shouldn't have been, going out too much. I'm still a young kid now, only 22, but when I first came onto the seen at 18 or 19 you have so much time to grow up on and off the pitch. ""Stuff happened, everyone is like it, but I was a young kid back then, I've grown up now. You see the light, I certainly have, and all I want to do is concentrate on my football and be the best I can be, and put all of that behind me."" ""He fits the Tottenham profile and can develop under Pochettino"" Tottenham have been looking for an attacker to play behind Kane with the likes of Eriksen and Dele Alli, and have been interested in Anthony Martial and Wilfried Zaha. Webb believes Grealish fits the profile of an intelligent attacking playmaker that can learn how to be effective in Mauricio Pochettino's system. ""Technically, he could potentially be a top Premier League player. He's a very clever player and athletically he's quite good,"" Webb said. ""He's a very intelligent player on and off the ball - more of an Eriksen-type player (than the others Spurs have). He can also bypass players; he's very skillful. ""He hasn't got that top acceleration. He's not a Raheem Sterling, who is going to bypass players with speed, but he can bypass with small acceleration and then execute a through pass or shot on goal, or develop play in that area. He is more of a player that can unlock doors and offer a little bit of a goal-threat as well. ""In Tottenham's system he would play behind the striker, in the attacking three. Those players - an Eriksen, [Erik] Lamela, [Heung-Min] Son or Alli - they want to roam and interchange, be quite sharp and understand the way Pochettino plays. It's very fast, on the transition and, for them, about knowing where to run, how to run. Grealish would have that. ""I am not surprised they have gone for him because of his quality and the improvements he has made. He is British as well, and there are not too many players like that, that are British-based. Being that and being someone who can develop under Pochettino, it's no surprise to me. Under a developer and teacher like Pochettino, it could be time that he is ready to work with someone like that."" The financial aspect From a business point of view, Tottenham are hoping to capitalise on Villa's financial problems to land a young British talent that would otherwise be worth much more to a club that does not have to accrue funds. However, Villa value their prize asset at closer to double the ¬£15m figure Spurs have offered and, despite their precarious financial state, senior sources at Villa believe they may not be forced to sell their star academy graduate after all. At Monday's crucial board meeting, acting deputy chief executive Luke Organ painted a more optimistic picture of the club's finances and, while not ruling it out, suggested they may not be forced to sell the youngster. Grealish remaining at Villa Park appears unlikely, though, with the player entering the last two years of his contract and Villa failing to get him to sign an extension midway through last season.",FALSE
235,Tottenham leading race to sign Aston Villa star Jack Grealish,"Tottenham are leading the race to sign Jack Grealish from Aston Villa, according to reports. Grealish, the 22-year-old playmaker, looks likely to leave Villa Park this summer following the club¬ís failure to win promotion from the second tier; Villa were defeated by Fulham in the play-off final last month. Grealish caught the eye in the play-off final, even though Villa were defeated by Fulham Villa value Grealish at around ¬£40m, according to the Daily Mail , but they may be forced to sell some of their prize assets this summer due to the perilous financial situation they find themselves in. Villa have resolved issues with HMRC over a missed tax payment, but they need to raise cash over the long-term, and owner Dr Tony Xia is considering selling the club. Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, believes Grealish has all the ability needed to fit into his young Spurs team, while Grealish himself favours a move to north London ahead of Leicester City, Everton or West Ham, who are all reported to also be keen on the 22-year-old.",FALSE
236,"Tottenham 'must pay premium' for Jack Grealish after Aston Villa takeover, says Steve Bruce","Tottenham Hotspur have been dealt a huge blow in their chase for Aston Villa star Jack Grealish after the Midlands club's new owners refused to let him go on the cheap. Villa boss Steve Bruce claims the American financer and Egyptian billionaire who now control the club will accept nothing less than a 'premium' for any of their star players. While Spurs have reportedly tabled a ¬£20million offer for Grealish , Villa are said to be holding out for double that amount, and as their dire financial situation has now been eased, they can afford to play hardball. Bruce told reporters: ""I know for a fact from the owners ‚Äì new investors ‚Äì anybody wanting to buy Jack Grealish will not buy him on the cheap. ""So if anybody is going to buy one of our players now they are going to have to pay a premium."" Spurs are still yet to make a signing this summer, but have tied the likes of Harry Kane, Heung-Min Son and Erik Lamela down to new long-term deals, as well as boss Mauricio Pochettino. This has not been enough to placate some fans however, worried that the lack of incomings could be the start of a long-term period of austerity as they struggle to cover the ¬£1billion cost of their new stadium . Just two weeks remain for Spurs to dip into their transfer budget before the window slams shut early on August 9. The club could be forced to put out a second-string side for their opener against Newcastle two days later, with a league-leading NINE players having made it all the way to the World Cup's final weekend and requiring a longer break. Earlier this summer Bruce told talkSPORT that Grealish could play 'for any team', such was the level of his talent. The winger, who chose to hold out for an England call-up rather than accept an offer to play international football for Ireland, was one of Villa's key men last year as they reached the Championship play-off final. After defeat to Fulham at Wembley, it was expected that Grealish would follow John Terry out of the exit door in favour of a Premier League side. But with Villa holding firm, he may be set for another season in the second tier. Bruce himself has been placed in a precarious position by the takeover, with rumours circulating that the new owners could replace him with Thierry Henry , who left his role as a Sky Sports pundit to pursue a managerial career.",FALSE
237,Jack Grealish to Tottenham: Club confident of deal and key rule could speed up talks,"Spurs, who are yet to spend any money this summer, face starting the season with a reduced squad. Mauricio Pochettino currently has seven homegrown stars in his first-team plans, one short of the minimum required. That means the north Londoners would only be able to name 24 players in their Premier League squad at the start of the new season rather than the full 25. The London Evening Standard report that Aston Villa star Grealish could be the man to complete Tottenham's ranks. It is said Spurs are confident of signing the England Under-21 midfielder before the transfer window closes on August 9. Villa are demanding upwards of ¬£40m and Tottenham remain in talks to try and negotiate a deal. The Lilywhites, who are set to move into their new stadium, are one of only two clubs yet to make a new signing this summer. Pochettino insists his side are working hard to sign stars but will not make any rash decisions. ""We're working hard trying to improve the squad,"" Pochettino said. ""The market has only started to move very quickly after the World Cup. ""Be sure that we are going to do some movement but like always, we're working hard [but will make] no rash decisions. ""I'm not worried, I'm happy preparing the team to arrive in the best condition for the first Premier League game."" Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce spoke out about Grealish this week and has reiterated that the 22-year-old will not move 'on the cheap' Bruce said: ""I know for a fact from the owners - new investors - anybody wanting to buy Jack Grealish will not buy him on the cheap. ""It's only what somebody else is prepared to pay - what he's worth. Until I have the conversation I can't really answer the question. What is he worth? Who knows?""

238,Tottenham transfer news: Jack Grealish deal won't happen because of one player - pundit,"That is the verdict of ESPN FC pundit and former USA international Brian McBride. Aston Villa ace Grealish has been linked with Tottenham for the majority of the transfer window. McBride understands the 22-year-old would want to play in the Premier League. But he does not think Tottenham would be the right club to progress his career. ""I don't understand this move,"" McBride said. ""I think I can understand it from Spurs' standpoint, you see a dynamic player, very good with the ball at his feet in tight spaces, can pick a pass, has a change of pace. ""He's just nowhere near the quality Eriksen is right now, so he's not going to replace a player like Eriksen. ""If Eriksen goes down (injured), and I think this is why you can see Spurs' interest, he would be a decent fit in there. ""But if I'm Grealish, I'm thinking I need to continue to play. ""Yeah, certainly I would love to play in the Premier League and prove I can play there. ""But Tottenham is not the place for him, so I don't think this is a good move.""

239,Tottenham to bid for Jack Grealish as Mauricio Pochettino identifies Aston Villa star as prime summer target,"T ottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy is set to test crisis club Aston Villa's insistence they will not sell Jack Grealish for under ¬£40 million by making a bid for the midfielder. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has identified Grealish as a prime summer target and Spurs want to move quickly to take advantage of Villa's money problems . The Championship club will have to cash in on Grealish this summer after failure to win promotion to the Premier League left them in a financial mess. Levy will believe he can get Grealish for as little as ¬£15m, despite Villa's attempts to stress they will not sell their prized asset on the cheap. That could make negotiations strained, but Levy will know that Villa are not in a strong position to stick to their guns having only just staved off the immediate threat of administration by settling their bill with HMRC. Pochettino has been hugely successful developing young talent and thinks he can groom Grealish's talent in the same way he has with Dele Alli. Grealish is close friends with Dele and, although he is a boyhood Villa fan, the 22 year-old is likely to find the prospect of joining Tottenham and working under Pochettino appealing. H e has already been linked with Manchester United, Newcastle United and Leicester City, but Tottenham have jumped to the front of the queue for Grealish in the last couple of days. W ith Mousa Dembele's future in doubt and Harry Winks missing a long period of last season through injury, Pochettino wants to strengthen his midfield options. He also wants a centre-back and is hoping to sign Manchester United's unhappy forward Anthony Martial. Villa, meanwhile, are also facing a battle to keep Wales international James Chester, with a number of Premier League clubs ready to offer ¬£8m. Chester was arguably Villa's player of the year last season and it has emerged that technical director Steve Round has already knocked back a serious inquiry from one club, believed to be Brighton. Villa have dispensed with the services of former Chelsea and Leeds chief executive Trevor Birch, who was brought in by Keith Wyness to help ease their financial worries. Birch was assisting Villa earlier this week but Villa believe they no longer need him as they pursue investment, after agreeing a deal with HMRC to settle the ¬£4.2m tax bill.",FALSE

Grealish scored three goals and made eight assists as Villa reached the Championship play-off final but they lost to Fulham at Wembley. Liverpool have been strongly linked with a move for the England Under-21 international, who is valued at ¬£20m by Steve Bruce's side. Bruce appeared to pre-empt Grealish's exit this summer after admitting the club's finances would mean he would have to be sold. 'I have enjoyed working with Jack, and Jack is the obvious one that clubs [are going to target] because he had a wonderful six months,' he told Sky Sports . 'He reminded everybody as a 22-year-old what a very good player he is. 'On another day at Wembley (Play-Off final versus Fulham) he could have scored one of the great Wembley goals. 'He is a special talent, a real special talent, and yes, you don't want to lose him but the inevitable thing is we have to. 'We have to ‚Äì to keep the club up and running and keep it in line with Financial Fair Play.'

Tottenham believe they can finance a deal for Martial but United have told Spurs that he will not be sold to a rival, according to the Manchester Evening News . Spurs know United are keen on signing Toby Alderweireld and believed they could talk United down from their ¬£70m valuation of Martial. The Frenchman left United's tour of the United States earlier this week to attend the birth of his second child. Martial is unlikely to fly back to the States for United's next two matches and may only play one more pre-season game before United kick off their Premier League campaign against Leicester City. The Frenchman's agent confirmed earlier this summer that Martial wants to leave the club after three years in the north-west. Martial was enjoying a good run in the side before Alexis Sanchez's arrival in January and failed to score after the Chilean's move to Old Trafford.

252,Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof wanted by Everton after just one season at Old Trafford,"EVERTON have been linked with a surprise move to sign Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof. New Everton boss Marco Silva is looking to overhaul his squad following his appointment as successor to Sam Allardyce. One of the key areas of concern for the former Watford boss will be to improve a defence that shipped too many goals last season. And the Mirror claim the main player in his sights is United defender Lindelof - just a year after he moved to the the club. Lindelof, 23, has struggled to establish himself at Old Trafford since his ¬£31.5million move from Benfica last summer. But that appears to not be a concern for Silva and Everton's new director of football Marcel Brands. The pair have been busy drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to deliver a squad capable of challenging for a place in the top eight next season. Lindelof is claimed to be the main defensive target, even though he suffered problems settling into life in the North-West. The Swedish international, currently preparing for the World Cup, had a good reputation in Portugal before joining United. And Silva's strong knowledge of the Portuguese game appears to have led him to the view the centre-back can succeed in the Premier League. Despite his problems at Old Trafford, manager Jose Mourinho has not given up hope that one of his big signings last year can come good. He is not on the list of squad players who Mourinho is looking to move on as he plots his own big changes over the course of the transfer window. So Everton will need to pay big money if they are to persuade United to sell, which could see them having to go as high as ¬£35m. SIGN UP FOR DREAM TEAM WORLD CUP NOW If Silva did come up with that kind of money, it may tempt Mourinho into selling, in the knowledge he has plenty of depth in that area. Lindelof is one of six centre-backs at Old Trafford, along with Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Chris Smalling and Daley Blind. Blind looks the most likely of that group to be moved on over the close season, while there also doubts over the long-term future of Smalling.",FALSE
253,Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof wanted by Everton boss Marco Silva,"Everton boss Marco Silva wants to bring out-of-favour Manchester United centre-back Victor Lindelof to Goodison Park this summer. Silva, who was recently announced as the new Toffees manager, has drawn up a list of transfer targets as he plans a complete overhaul of the club. And, according to the Mirror, he has prioritised a potential ¬£35million move for 23-year-old defender Lindelof. Lindelof only made 13 league appearances for United as he struggled to make an impact following his ¬£31.5million switch from Benfica last summer. He made two costly mistakes at Huddersfield as the Red Devils slipped to a shock 2-1 defeat and the Swede is yet to live up to the reputation he developed in Portugal. But Silva, who has an impressive knowledge of Portuguese football, rates him highly. There's no indication that Jose Mourinho wants to ditch Lindelof and United insiders believe he will be given another season to impress the boss. However, there is no shortage of centre-backs at Old Trafford, with Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind also in the ranks. Lindelof will travel to the World Cup with Sweden and his manager Janne Andersson expects him to eventually become a hit at United. He said: ""Victor was outstanding in our two World Cup play-off games against Italy when they didn't score against us in either game.

Lindelof made just 17 appearances in the league last season as Jose Mourinho's side came second behind Manchester City. And the Portuguese manager is in the market for another centre-back, underlining his lack of confidence in the former Primeira Liga defender. Toby Alderweireld, Raphael Varane and Clement Lenglet have all been linked with moves to the Red Devils this summer as Mourinho eyes a mini-clearout at the back. And among them, according to the Mirror , could be Lindelof - who is wanted by new Everton manager Silva. The fellow Portugal manager is also a close friend of Mourinho's and is eyeing a move for the big Swede. The ex-Watford coach is keen to reinforce his backline after an unsettled season under Ronald Koeman, David Unsworth and Sam Allardyce. Michael Keane and Ashley Williams have been disastrous at the back at times whilst Phil Jagielka is well past his best. The Toffees have high hopes for the likes of Mason Holgate and Jonjoe Kenny, but Silva wants some international experience.

Unai Emery has a limited transfer budget this summer after Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for a second year in a row and was hoping to get a bargain with Martins available for nothing. Emery has already gone about reshaping his squad but fancied Martins to bolster his attack. The Portugal winger, 23, requested his Sporting contract was ripped up on June 11 after the incident which saw supporters invade and attack players at the training ground in Lisbon. Martins was with Portugal at the World Cup and was sent home from Russia by Uruguay last Saturday.

According to the report, Pope is being targeted not just because of his proven Premier League experience. The 26-year-old is available or just ¬£15m, the Sun on Sunday claim, and that appears to be a deal too good for Liverpool to turn down. Pope only joined Burnley in 2016 and has a contract with the club until the end of the 2019/20 season.

He will also come in far cheaper than Liverpool's other goalkeeper targets. The report claims Pope will cost just ¬£15m - a bargain compared to the ¬£70m quoted for either Donnarumma or Alisson. Liverpool would also be buying a home-grown player, adding to their quota of at least eight in a squad of 25.

""However, it is quite obvious and it is very important to remember that he is under contract, that Manchester United will have the last word and that we will respect the decision of the club, and he will fulfil his commitment to them. ""However, we do not share the same vision for Anthony's future. Today, Anthony is disappointed because he has shown for three seasons the love he has for the club and its supporters."" Tottenham were interested in Martial originally before he signed for United under Louis van Gaal.

Manchester United are long-term admirers and remain interested in a move for the former Tottenham player. They will be at the front of any queue this summer should Madrid sanction his sale. But following the resignation of coach Zinedine Zidane in the wake of the club's third successive Champions League triumph, a source close to Bale has told ESPN FC that he is ready to grasp the opportunity of proving himself to Lopetegui, who was unveiled by Madrid on Thursday after his dismissal as Spain coach on Wednesday. While Bale remains determined to play more often for Madrid after spending much of last season under Zidane on the substitutes' bench, his first preference is to stay rather than move elsewhere. He is under contract at Real until the end of the 2021-22 season, having signed a six-year deal in October 2016, and is confident that he can still contribute in the biggest games for the club, having scored key goals against Barcelona and Liverpool in the final weeks of last season.

Players and staff were then attacked at the training ground by a group of around 50 fans after they missed out on qualification for the Champions League. However, no one can question that Martins was one of the standout performers for Sporting. He produced 13 goals and provided the same amount of assists from the right side during his 52 appearances.

293,Rui Patricio signs for Wolves from Sporting Lisbon,"Portugal goalkeeper Rui Patricio has signed for Wolves on a four-year deal from Sporting Lisbon. Patricio, 30, won his 70th cap for Portugal in their 2018 World Cup opener against Spain last week and was part of the squad that won Euro 2016. He opted to break his Sporting Lisbon contract after a group of around 50 masked supporters broke into the club's headquarters and physically assaulted players and staff in May as they were preparing for a training session ahead of the Portuguese Cup final against Aves. Patricio was one of a number of players to cite the 'just cause' in relation to the lack of safety and protection highlighted by the attack. Wolves had been reported to be willing to pay ¬£18m for the goalkeeper before he opted to terminate his contract, allowing him to join the English club for free. Sporting Lisbon could yet be owed a compensation fee though if the case goes to a FIFA tribunal. He had been at the Portuguese club since the age of 12, making 460 appearances, including 26 in the Champions League. Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo has already signed Mexico international Raul Jimenez from Benfica this summer as he looks to strengthen the club's squad ahead of their return to the Premier League. The Midlands club comfortably won the Sky Bet Championship last season with the help of a number of Portuguese imports brought in as part of Wolves' close relationship with super agent Jorge Mendes.

Leicester and Everton are known to be keen too and The Sun now add that Liverpool have registered their interest too. It is said that the Reds are willing to offer more than what Tottenham are in order to secure Grealish's signature. The attacking midfielder is interested to work with either Mauricio Pochettino or Jurgen Klopp and it appears it will be a straight shootout between the Premier Legaue giants. Spurs have made Grealish their top priority target this summer but chairman Daniel Levy is currently playing hardball with Villa in an attempt to drive down their valuation. That means Liverpool could swoop in and beat their rivals to a deal. Tottenham are yet to make their first signing of the summer and their budget is tight ahead of their move into their new north London stadium. Liverpool, meanwhile, have already shelled out close to ¬£100m on Monaco's Fabinho and Naby Keita of RB Leipzig.

Pochettino believes Grealish could have a similar inspirational impact to the Tottenham side as Paul Gascoigne did when he moved to White Hart Lane from Newcastle in 1988. But the Argentinian faces missing out on his priority signing because chairman Daniel Levy is attempting to force Villa to accept a cut-price ¬£20million bid. Cash-strapped Villa, who are facing huge financial problems having failed to gain promotion back to the Premier League, value the 22-year-old at ¬£40m. But Levy is attempting to use the Championship club's precarious plight as leverage to drive down the transfer fee. The notoriously tough negotiator has set ¬£20m as his maximum offer and is holding firm, confident Grealish wants to make the move to North London. And with the only other interested clubs until now being Leicester and Everton, Spurs were in a powerful position in the haggling. But Sunsport understands Liverpool have now registered their interest with Villa - changing the complexion of the transfer completely. They too can dangle the carrot of working under a charismatic manager in an evolving team who are fighting for honours at the top end of the Premier League. Jurgen Klopp's side also have Champions League football to sell to Grealish, something Leicester and Everton were unable to do. Spurs now face genuine competition for the services of the Villa star, who is tipped to force his way into the England squad over the coming year. And Liverpool are understood to be willing to pay more than the ¬£20m Spurs have tabled to bring in the midfielder. Klopp is attempting to build a squad capable of a dual challenge for the Premier League title and in Europe next season, and Grealish would be a natural fit in his plans.",FALSE

Tottenham have turned their noses up at that price, and the Sunday Express report that's left Liverpool in pole position to get him. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy won't pay more than ¬£20m for the midfielder, meaning his club's interest in the England Under-21 international has cooled. Chelsea, Leicester and Everton are also interested in the 22-year-old but Liverpool are said to be in the best position to get him as they are prepared to pay more and offer additional performance-related clauses into any deal.

But they may have to accept far less now they have to rebalance the books after failing to land a Premier League promotion pay-day. Mauricio Pochettino wants the Englishman to join up with the squad for the start of their pre-season tour, and Spurs are said to be considering a ¬£20,000-a-week deal to tempt him to North London. With the club expected to move into their new stadium over the next couple of months, it will be an exciting new era for the club, who also have Champions League football to look forward to. Grealish starred for Steve Bruce's side last season but could not help fire them back into the Premier League as they finished behind Wolves, Cardiff and Fulham in the table. And they then lost to the Cottagers in the play-off final at Wembley, essentially making his career decision for him. He netted three times in 30 Championship games last season and played in Villa's sole FA Cup game, a 3-1 third round defeat to Peterborough. Bruce has admitted Grealish's sale would be huge for the club to get on with making other recruits. Tottenham leave for the United States on Sunday with a raft of stars being rested after the end of the World Cup. A three-game tour sees them play Roma, AC Milan and Barcelona in the set of glorified friendlies known as the International Champions Cup. Bruce said earlier this month: ""There will be nobody feeling sorry for Aston Villa because financially we have got ourselves in a bit of a pickle, so yes we have got to be ready for that. ""I have enjoyed working with Jack, and Jack is the obvious one that clubs (are going to target) because he had a wonderful six months.

But there is on-going uncertainty at Villa Park over Grealish as the club are still under pressure from Financial Fair Play rules. SunSport understands the Villa academy product is keen to hear what Pochettino has to say but will not kick up a fuss and demand to leave Villa Park this summer.

""I love him, because he's a boy who loves football, who endears himself to you and who gives you all of his heart and his ability ‚Äî and he has a lot."" Ever Banega revealed his time under Unai Emery at Valencia played a big part in him joining Sevilla in 2014. ""The relationship with Unai is very good, they were my best years in Valencia,"" said Banega. ""Having worked with him is obviously a plus, but first I want to work with my colleagues and put myself at the mister's [manager] disposal."" Arsenal are set to meet with Ever Banega's agent, Marcelo Simonian, to discuss a deal, according to Italian outlet Tutto Mercato Web . The agent has apparently jetted into London and the Gunners are set to make an offer for his client at Unai Emery's request. Sevilla's interest in selling Banega, who played 47 times for them this season, is as yet unknown. However, it has been claimed the 29-year-old is comfortable with life in Sevilla, where his family have settled in well. Emery seemingly faces a battle to convince Banega to up sticks and head to Arsenal this summer.

New Gunners manager Unai Emery has already completed two signings this summer. Now Gazza Mercato claim the Argentina international, 29, could be about to become the third. The Spanish publication says the midfielder's agent will hold talks with Arsenal this week. Banega has spent most of his career in La Liga since leaving his homeland a decade ago. He joined Valencia in 2008 and enjoyed loan spells at Atletico Madrid and Newell's Old Boys back in Argentina prior to signing for Sevilla in 2014. After two years he departed to join Serie A giants Inter Milan in Italy but rejoined Sevilla 12 months later. Emery knows him well from his time in charge at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and is believed to have made him his next target. The ex-PSG boss has already completed moves for Juventus full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner and Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno.

Alderweireld is his top target while there have also links with Clement Lenglet and Leonardo Bonucci. But, according to ESPN , Tottenham will not sell ANY player until after the World Cup. Manchester United did want to get a deal done before the tournament in Russia kicked off but baulked at Tottenham's ¬£60m valuation. Mourinho wants a centre-back, left-back and a forward this summer and, until Marouane Fellaini signed is new deal, another midfielder despite the signing of Fred for ¬£53m. But with Fellaini opting to sign a new two-year deal Mourinho has more money spare to spend on the likes of Alderweireld. Express Sport also understands United are preparing a move to Willian. Barcelona made an opening offer of ¬£50m today but were knocked back, and United are ready to start a bidding war. Tottenham have also been trying to tie the Alderweireld deal in with getting Anthony Martial in return.

316,Man Utd transfer news: Toby Alderweireld move in the balance as Jose Mourinho awaits deals,"Jose Mourinho is a big fan of the Belgium star and is keen on doing a deal with Tottenham this summer. But Manchester United are worried about being held to ransom by Tottenham for a player who turns 30 next season. United are desperate to add strength to their defence and have held talks with Spurs over a deal for Tottenham. They did initially want to do a deal before the World Cup but it quickly became apparent that Tottenham would not negotiate easily. Tottenham are inclined to sell this summer ahead of next season when a clause in Alderweireld's contract can be triggered and he can be signed for just ¬£25m. They are looking for around ¬£60m this summer with United seeing if they can get better value elsewhere. A lot could depend on Raphael Varane's availability at Real Madrid while Seville's French defender Clement Lenglet is another option. Alderweireld though comes with Premier League experience and if they can get him for the right price would be a superb addition. He would be expected to slot in alongside Eric Bailly, although he lost his place towards the end of the season with Chris Smalling and Phil Jones given runs in the team. United have already signed midfielder Fred for ¬£52m and Diogo Dalot to add competition in defence. But they still want a centre-back, another midfielder and a forward. They are waiting to see on potential forward deals, with Gareth Bale an option, to weigh up how much money they have for other areas. Varane would also be more expensive than Alderweireld but would be a younger option should Madrid decide to sell after the change of manager.",FALSE
317,Man Utd transfer news: Ed Woodward failed Jose Mourinho over Toby Alderweireld pursuit,"Now two weeks on from Belgium's third-place play-off win over England, it is safe to say Woodward has failed him. A stellar international tournament often means big clubs having to fork out more than they normally would. United spent ¬£30million on Rio Ferdinand in 2002. Real Madrid broke the bank by signing James Rodriguez for ¬£60m in 2014. Chelsea paid ¬£50m for a crocked Fernando Torres in 2011, months after he had propelled Spain to the promise land. Alderweireld has, all summer, been there for the taking. Tottenham want ¬£50m because they know that, in 12 months time, they may be forced to lose him for half of that. The player impressing for Belgium, however, has complicated United's interest. Spurs are tough negotiators - and have been ever since 2008, when the Red Devils poached Dimitar Berbatov in controversial circumstances. As a result, United have been linked with Maguire. For all the claims that he wants to join, both the player and his representatives have made no comment so far on wanting to leave Leicester. Mourinho was aware Alderweireld would be difficult to sign after the World Cup. And so he told Woodward. But those words, it seems, have fallen on deaf ears. And United now face another season of Premier League turbulence. Alderweireld is a deal that could go the distance and reports have claimed United are still confident of doing a deal. Mourinho, judging by his frustrated body language, thinks differently. And only time will tell if Woodward has failed his manager. If they get their man, all is well. If they don't? Then do not expect Mourinho to return to his cheery self anytime soon.",TRUE

Rafael Leao, 19, is one of the Primeira Liga side's hottest prospects, but after the club's fans attacked the training ground last month he could join the long list of players who have terminated their contracts. Four members of Portugal 's World Cup squad - Rui Patricio, William Carvalho , Gelson Martins and Bruno Fernandes - were among those making themselves free agents after the attack, with keeper Patricio quickly snapped up by Wolves . Striker Bas Dost , reportedly injured in the incident, also tore up his contract and is looking for a new club after 61 goals in 61 league games. Leao has represented Portugal at five different youth levels and with City having first registered their interest in February , and he could tread a similar path to his hero, Cristiano Ronaldo , in swapping Lisbon for Manchester. In February the reported price tag on Leao's head was ¬£22.5million but after the crisis at Sporting he would now be available completely free . The Manchester Evening News reports that City could pay a small compensation fee to Sporting to avoid any legal issues surrounding the player terminating his own contract. Chelsea and Manchester United have also been linked to Leao, who scored his first goal for the club against fierce rivals Porto in March. He began his professional career with Sporting's B side, scoring seven times in his first 12 games.

Express Sport understands Ronaldo is angling for another new Real Madrid contract that would see him match Neymar and Lionel Messi at the top of world football's money table. Given United's need for attacking stardust, the Red Devils' interest in their former flame is understandable. But Spanish outlet Diario Gol have now made a stunning claim about Ronaldo. The Portugal international is supposedly aware that United are hellbent on bringing him back this summer. The player fell out with Mourinho during the latter stages of his own time in La Liga. But Diario Gol say Mourinho is willing to move past that to bring Ronaldo back to United. And the veteran is also open to the idea, particularly if Real refuse to bow to his financial demands. Meanwhile, speaking ahead of Real's Champions League final clash with Liverpool, Ronaldo expressed a desire to play on until his 40s. ""I said I'm going to retire at 41. I'm 23 years old biologically,"" he said. ""The future is Saturday's game, you have to play, win and enter the history, it's the most important thing. The present is now.""

Spanish outlet Diario Gol say Cristiano Ronaldo feels his Real career will end if Tottenham boss Pochettino takes over. The Argentine is understood to be Los Blancos' No 1 choice to replace Zidane. Florentino Perez is a known admirer of Pochettino, who has won plenty of plaudits during his time at Tottenham. But Ronaldo, the report suggests, is not among them. The Portugal international supposedly feels Pochettino has done nothing to justify his huge billing. And, if the Spurs boss takes over, then Ronaldo expects his head to roll. United appear to have been earmarked as the players' No 1 destination if he opts to quit the Bernabeu. Speaking last week, former Real boss Fabio Capello confirmed this by saying: ""I think that Cristiano Ronaldo wants to go back to Manchester.

The Portugal international, who has four goals in two games at the World Cup, knows he will be received as a hero wherever he goes. New Real boss Julen Lopetegui is aware of the issue faced surrounding Ronaldo's position at the club. And Diario Gol add it is growing increasingly difficult for the La Liga giants to persuade their talisman to stay.

337,Chelsea transfer news: Ruben Loftus-Cheek could leave for one key reason,"That's according to Sky Sports reporter Dharmesh Sheth. The midfielder joined Crystal Palace on loan last season as he desperately sought first-team football and he enjoyed a stunning season at Selhurst Park, playing a pivotal role as they recovered from a nightmare start to avoid relegation. Loftus-Cheek's impressive performances earned him a place in England's World Cup squad and he's been prominent in the side during the march to the semi-finals. The 22-year-old's future is unclear, with Chelsea's managerial situation clouded in uncertainty. Loftus-Cheek wants guarantees of regular football and if he isn't afforded that at Stamford Bridge then he could look elsewhere. Roy Hodgson has made no secret of his desire to bring the youngster back to Selhurst Park next term, while West Ham and Everton have also expressed an interest. And Sheth has explained the reasoning behind Loftus-Cheek's disrupted career, insisting that he wants the security of regular game time. ""It's very interesting that Chelsea do rate him,"" he told the Transfer Talk podcast. ""But every manager that has come in, I think they look at the shelf-life of the manager at Chelsea and think 'right, do I give these youngsters a chance or do I just get the ready-made article?' ""That's what's happened. Maybe it needs a change of tact at Chelsea from the very top to say 'right, we'll be patient with you as a manager, we want you to bring these youngsters through'.

The 24-year-old has been unable to cement a regular place in Real Madrid's first-team and has admitted he is keen to leave the Spanish heavyweights this summer. A number of clubs have been linked with a move for Kovacic and Premier League giants United have joined the race to secure his signature, according to the Daily Mail . Jose Mourinho signed Brazilian star Fred earlier in the month but will look to bring another top class midfielder to Old Trafford, particularly if Marouane Fellaini leaves. But United will find it difficult to secure a deal with Real Madrid as they value Kovacic highly and he has a ¬£265million release clause. Kovacic, who is currently with the Croatia team at the World Cup in Russia, has also emerged as a target for Premier League champions Manchester City. This week, Fellaini confirmed a decision over his future at Manchester United would be made 'soon' ‚Äì he is expected to leave after turning down multiple offers to sign a new deal. Anthony Martial, the French forward, could follow Fellaini out of the exit door after his agent revealed he wanted to leave to revive his career.

And he could make a fresh foray into the transfer market to bring in more competition for the Brazilian, Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic. Kovacic has been touted as an option for Manchester United after revealing he is eager to call time on his stint at Real.

Estadio Deportivo claims the Argentine playmaker is being lined up for a summer switch to the Emirates after working with Emery at Sevilla and Valencia. Banega is said to have a ¬£17.5million release clause and could be the ideal replacement for Jack Wilshere, who has left the Gunners on a free transfer. However, the report adds the 29-year-old has some concerns about leaving Spain for a new project in an alien country. Arsenal are also believed to be closing in on Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira, and Banega may not be guaranteed a regular place in the starting XI. Emery has already signed up two players for his North London revolution, with veteran right-back Stephan Lichsteiner arriving upon the expiry of his Juventus contract. German goalkeeper Bernd Leno has since followed from Bayer Leverkusen in a ¬£20m deal. And next to arrive at the Emirates could be Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos.

The midfielder has played for new Gunners boss Unai Emery at both Valencia and Sevilla in the past, which may give the north London outfit a helpful advantage this summer. And Arsenal will be buoyed by the news coming out of Spain regarding Banega's current happiness. According to Estadio Deportivo, the 29-year-old is furious that the club decided to part ways with Oscar Arias. The former Sevilla sporting director is incredibly close with Banega and his family. Arias is said to be one of the main reasons the player decided to return to Seville after a short stint with Inter Milan in 2016. The 52-year-old was sacked after Sevilla's 5-0 Copa del Rey final defeat to Barcelona in April. Estadio Deportivo also report Banega is now ready to leave the Spanish outfit this summer once he has returned from the World Cup. Sevilla have slapped a ‚Ç¨20m (¬£17.5m) price tag on the midfielder.

Banega started twice for his country at the World Cup but was unable to prevent Argentina crashing out at the last 16 stage at the hands of France. But despite Arsenal's interest, the 30-year-old looks set to snub the Gunners and stay in La Liga next season. According to Marca , Banega has told Sevilla that he is committed to them and has no intention of leaving this summer. Emery knows the midfielder well having worked with him while in charge of the Spanish club. But there's unlikely to be a Premier League reunion, forcing Arsenal to explore alternative options.

He has not ruled out making further additions, recently saying he would consider more signings, per James Benge of the Evening Standard . Herrera, 28, was a sensible target as Arsenal's midfield is still lacking in steal and guile despite recent changes.

As for Herrera, he could well now sign a new contract at Porto as his current deal expires in 2019. He has been at Porto since 2013 and played a key role as they won the league last term.

The club are said to be aware of his movement and have given him permission to extend his break. Willian has been linked with both Manchester United and Barcelona, but the Spanish champions have since snapped up Malcom after seeing two bids knocked back. United are still in the hunt for a winger but yesterday Willian claimed he was happy at Chelsea. When asked if he was on the move this summer he told Globo Esporte: ""No, I'm back to England. I'm very happy at Chelsea. ""I'm very happy living in London."" However he remains on United's radar as Jose Mourinho looks to add another forward to his ranks. Ivan Perisic is understood to be his top target after a move for Gareth Bale proved impossible. Willian would cost around ¬£70m as Chelsea look to generate funds for new boss Maurizio Sarri and United are hesitant to pay big for players approaching their 30s. Willian will be 30 on transfer deadline day and will have little sell-on value. Mourinho is also after a central defender and expects to still get one deal done before next Thursday.

Willian has been linked with a transfer to Old Trafford for several months, but his focus was solely on Brazil's World Cup campaign since the end of the club season. Brazil's exit from the tournament after a 2-1 defeat to Belgium in the quarter-finals means Willian can now turn his attentions to his club future. The Sun claim United believe they have won the race for Willian's signature and the deal can now be finalised. United were waiting for Willian's duties with Brazil to run their course, and is now confident they can quickly complete the signing. Willian would leave Chelsea amidst managerial chaos at the club as Antonio Conte returned to Cobham for day one of pre-season. Conte was expected to have been given the boot by now to allow former Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri to take over, but there has yet to be any confirmation of who will be in charge next season. Chelsea want to axe Conte, but are reluctant to fork out his ¬£9million compensation fee, as well as pay Napoli the figure they are demanding for Sarri. Conte is prepared to kick off Chelsea's pre-season on Monday after medical checks on Saturday, but it remains to be see if the Premier League and FA Cup winner will indeed still be in charge by then. Willian's departure would surely annoy Chelsea fans, as the Brazilian is one of the most liked performers in the squad. Joining United would allow Willian to reunite with former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, who believes the attacker can add the width and pace his side need on the right side of midfield. Willian will not come cheap as Chelsea have the 29-year-old under contract until 2020.",FALSE

The Germany star arrived in 2014 from Bayern Munich and, since then, has helped Los Blancos win three Champions League titles on the trot. Mourinho is not, meanwhile, the first United manager to try and sign Kroos. David Moyes was adamant he had secured Kroos' signature four years ago before he was axed and replaced with Louis van Gaal.

But United may struggle to come to an agreement with Valencia unless they adhere to the La Liga side's demands. According to newspaper Super Deporte, Valencia have opened talks with United bosses over a proposed deal. However, officials at the Mestalla want to insert a purchase option into any loan agreement. Super Deporte claim the purchase option is an 'essential requirement' for the club. And that may put United off making a deal, with Jose Mourinho keen to have Fosu-Mensah on his books for the long term. Mourinho has three full-backs at his disposal already - Antonio Valencia, Diogo Dalot and Matteo Darmian all play on the right side of defence. So an agreement to sell Fosu-Mensah does not seem totally improbable. But the Portuguese manager is looking at the future and that's where Fosu-Mensah comes in. Darmian is expected to join Juventus this summer, while Antonio Valencia at the age of 32 is nearing the twilight of his career.

358,Mohamed Salah signs new Liverpool contract after brilliant season,"Mohamed Salah has signed a new long-term contract at Liverpool. The 26-year-old Egyptian has committed his future to the club after a remarkable debut season on Merseyside. Sky sources report that the new deal will keep Salah at Liverpool until at least 2023 and does not contain a release clause. Having signed from Roma last summer, Salah scored 44 goals in 52 appearances - the second most prolific season in Liverpool's history. . @MoSalah has a message for all you Reds... https://t.co/EmC7lbLdBK pic.twitter.com/FBKfXfWe6G His Golden Boot winning tally of 32 Premier League goals was a record for a 38-game season and he was named the PFA Player of the Year and the Football Writer's Player of the Year. With Salah to the fore, Liverpool reached the Champions League final, where they lost 3-1 to Real Madrid, and finished fourth in the Premier League. The club have now ended any speculation about Salah's long-term future - and manager Jurgen KIopp has welcomed the announcement. Klopp said on the club's official website: ""I think this news can be seen for what it is - rewarding a person who performed and contributed greatly for the team and the club last season. ""It demonstrates two things very clearly also - his belief in Liverpool and our belief in him. ""We want world-class talent to see they have a home at Anfield, where they can fulfil all their professional dreams and ambitions. We are working hard together to achieve this. ""When someone like Mo Salah commits and says this place is my home now, it speaks very loudly I think. ""Equally, our commitment to him says we see his value and want him to grow even more and get even better within our environment. ""The key thing to remember is the best thing about Mo is that he never sees himself as being more important than the team or anyone else within it. ""He recognises his team-mates and this club helped him achieve individual success last season. He sees the individual awards come because he is part of something bigger that is special. ""Mo reflects where we are as a team, I think. Last season was special with many special moments - but we want more. ""We want to be more successful and achieve more together. As the supporters sang so loudly, 'we're never gonna stop'. ""This has to be the attitude individually and collectively."" In a video posted on Liverpool's social media channels, Salah said: ""I'm very happy to say I have signed a new contract with the club. ""My first year at the club was an incredible experience for me and my family. I have to thank everyone at Liverpool and also you, our supporters. ""I know we can achieve a lot of things together (and) I'm looking forward to seeing you."" Salah ended on a negative as he had to be substituted in the first half of the Champions League final after suffering a shoulder injury. The problem forced him to miss Egypt's World Cup opener against Uruguay and, although he scored against Russia and Saudi Arabia, the African nation exited at the group stage without claiming a point.",TRUE

Sky sources understand Barcelona first began efforts to lure Willian to the Nou Camp as long as three months ago. Sky Sports News reported in May that Manchester United are also interested in signing the versatile winger this summer, with the forward wanting to leave Stamford Bridge if Antonio Conte remained as head coach. Willian made 55 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea last season, scoring 13 goals. However, he was left out of the starting line-up for the 1-0 FA Cup final win over United at Wembley, coming on as an injury time substitute.

But Chelsea rebuffed all of Barca's offers to keep hold of the 29-year-old, who is also of interest to Premier League rivals Manchester United. The La Liga champions seem to have turned their attentions away from a deal for Willian after completing a late swoop to pluck Bordeaux forward Malcom from Roma's clutches for around ¬£37m. But according to Mundo Deportivo , as well as Barca's cash-only bids, Chelsea rejected the idea of signing Andre Gomes as part of a deal. It is claimed that Barca would have paid as much as ‚Ç¨50million (¬£44.4m) and also offered Portuguese international Gomes to Chelsea in a package to recruit Willian. But the Blues still turned down Barca's interest and the Catalan club opted to pursue another Brazilian winger, Malcom, as a younger and cheaper alternative. Gomes, meanwhile, has long been linked with a ‚Ç¨30m (¬£26m) move to Arsenal this summer. The 24-year-old appears certain to leave the Nou Camp having been left out of Barca's 28-man squad for their pre-season tour of the United States. Mundo Deportivo have also separately speculated that United are willing to meet Chelsea's demands for Willian with Jose Mourinho keen on a reunion with the forward. Croatian wide-man Ante Rebic has been mentioned as a potential alternative for the Red Devils, who have also been linked with Real Madrid's Gareth Bale and Rebic's compatriot Ivan Perisic, if an agreement cannot be reached for Mourinho's first-choice attacker.",FALSE

No move is expected to take place until Chelsea have their managerial situation resolved, with Maurizio Sarri poised to replace Antonio Conte. But talks with Barcelona over the Willian deal are progressing. That is according to Barcelona-based newspaper Mundo Deportivo, who have revealed details of the discussions being held between the two parties. Willian's agent Kia Joorabchian is in London trying to broker a deal for the 29-year-old to leave Stamford Bridge. The report claims 'Willian is determined to play at Barca' and has put his trust in the agent to get the deal over the line. Barca have already had an offer in excess of ¬£50m rejected by Chelsea. Mundo Deportivo claim the Blues want ¬£70m (‚Ç¨80m) for their playmaker, who supposedly fell out with manager Conte over the season. It is said that Barca CEO Oscar Grau watched Willian in action at the World Cup and has since returned from Russia, convinced the player is the right target for manager Ernesto Valverde. Funding the player's arrival may prove tricky, with MD pointing to the example of Paulinho taking a pay cut to join Barca last summer. They suggest a player-plus-cash deal may be on the cards, with Chelsea potentially offered Paulinho, Andre Gomes, Rafinha or Yerry Mina in order to drive the price down. Willian may also be asked to 'do his part to 'oil' the operation', which could mean a pay cut. He currently earns ¬£110,000 a week at Chelsea, having joined the club from Anzhi in 2013.",FALSE

363,Arsenal manager Unai Emery stance on Andre Gomes interest revealed,"Arsenal manager Unai Emery has no interest in signing Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes despite being linked with the Portugal international. The Independent suggested last week that the Gunners were looking to use the sale of Aaron Ramsey to fund the acquisition of the 24-year-old. Emery is understood to be a long-time admirer of Gomes and was preparing an offer for ¬£30m to bring him to The Emirates Stadium. However, those reports have been quashed after Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo claimed Emery is focusing his efforts on other midfield targets. Gomes has struggled for regular first team opportunities at Barcelona since arriving at the Nou Camp from Valencia in 2016. He has made just 39 starts in all competitions in two seasons with Barca and has failed to establish himself in a midfield which was added to by Philippe Coutinho's arrival last January. The ex-Benfica man missed swathes of last season through injury and as a result was among a handful of players left out of Portugal's World Cup squad who had won the European Championships with them two years previous. Meanwhile, Arsenal are reportedly on the brink of securing the signing of Lucas Torreira from Sampdoria while Matteo Guendouzi is also expected to move to north London. Four new players have already arrived at Arsenal since Emery was appointed Arsene Wenger's successor at Arsenal. Karl Jokob Hein has joined the club's academy, while Stephan Lichsteiner, Bernd Leno and Sokratic Papastathopoulos have all arrived to supplement the senior side. Sunderland youngster Sam Greenwood is likely to join that quartet after being spotted at the Arsenal training ground on Tuesday. Argentina international Ever Banega and his Sevilla teammate Steven N'Zonzi have been linked with moves to Arsenal following the exit of Jack Wilshere and amid uncertainty over the future of Ramsey.",FALSE
364,Arsenal boss Unai Emery targets Andre Gomes in ¬£30million transfer,"Andre Gomes is a transfer target of Unai Emery because the Arsenal boss sees the Barcelona ace as the perfect addition to his midfield, reports say. The Portugal international has failed to establish himself at Barcelona since arriving in 2016, and could be booted from the club this summer to make room for new signings. Gomes would be a surprise target for Emery, but the Arsenal boss is a massive admirer and thinks he can reignite the 24-year-old's form and confidence. The Independent claim Emery is so keen on Gomes, he is ready to sacrifice several Arsenal stars to raise the transfer funds. Arsenal's transfer kitty is almost empty after the additions of Bernd Leno, Stefan Lichtsteiner and Sokratis Papastathopoulos. Once Arsenal complete the signing of Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira, Emery will have spent the entirety of his budget and will need to sell to continue spending. Emery is prepared to do just that to land Gomes, who will cost around ¬£30million. Centre-back Calum Chambers has been given a new contract, but there are doubts about the futures of Shkodran Mustafi, Petr Cech, David Ospina and Lucas Perez. The sale of Mustafi and Perez could raise the necessary funds to bid for Gomes, as Emery sets his sights on firming up a fragile midfield. Gomes is under contract at Barcelona until 2021, meaning Barcelona can name their price for the Portuguese. Emery has been linked with several raids on La Liga this summer, with the Gunners said to be exploring the possibilities of signing Sevilla duo Ever Banega and Steven N'Zonzi. Interest in N'Zonzi has been ongoing for several months, while Banega is a favourite of Emery's having worked under the Spaniard at Sevilla and Valencia.",FALSE

Grant told the club's official website: ""Moving to Manchester United has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember.

United are not frightened by the fee or his salary, which is more than ¬£500,000 a week. They are prepared to offer their former star, 33, who quit for the Bernabeu in 2009, a three-year-deal. And they are also not worried by Ronaldo's poor relationship with Jose Mourinho during their time together at Real. But with United already privately conceding they cannot capture Ronaldo's team-mate Gareth Bale, CR7 had become the subject of open discussion within the club's hierarchy. Chelsea's Willian remains a major target but the club are not prepared to match Chelsea's ¬£70m asking price. Woodward accepts that to try and rival the Premier League supremacy of Manchester City, Mourinho needs an iconic figure. One that would have as big an impact on the pitch as he would have with shirt sales and sponsorship deals. United are well aware no deal has been struck with Juve, who would also be financially stretched to pay the sums mentioned.

It is claimed that the Red Devils boss had two players on his radar and, ultimately, he signed one of them. Those two men were Nemanja Matic and Eric Dier. Manchester United are a club footballers dream of playing for. And Roma centre-back Kostas Manolas, who has frequently been tipped to join a Premier League club, is no different.

Despite his advancing years, Cristiano Ronaldo remains Real Madrid's talisman having propelled them to Champions League glory three years on the spin. Reports have claimed Manchester United are above PSG in the race for his signature with Jose Mourinho keen to add some stardust to his side.

Piecing the puzzle together, it means that, if Ronaldo becomes available, the Red Devils can be expected to pursue his signature. PSG have also been tipped to sign him. But Ronaldo has dropped numerous hints via various parties that a United return is his priority. The player has always ensured he maintain a close rapport with Red Devils fans. And, speaking recently, his mother dropped a hint by saying ""I like Paris. I come every now and again. ""The last time was when my son received the Ballon d'Or. ""It was a great honour.

The player has already hinted at a move away, with Ronaldo's comments putting Manchester United on red alert.

There have been reports that Ronaldo will eventually make the move back to Old Trafford.

Arsenal want Gomes to add some solidity to their midfield, despite having Lucas Torreira, Granit Xhaka, Mohamed Elneny and Aaron Ramsey on the books.

The Gunners, who are facing competition for the former Valencia man, will then have the option to sign him permanently in 12 months' time.

The forward is seeking the same lofty salaries as Neymar and Lionel Messi. However, should they choose not to reward their star man with a bumper new deal, then a United return could be in the offing.

That has left Jurgen Klopp's side reassessing their options after having identified Fekir as their No 1 target to fill in the creative role vacated since Philippe Coutinho's move to Barcelona back in January. Liverpool are also keen to recruit depth out wide as they look to ensure they have ample back-up for their front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane - who plundered a combined 91 goals last term.

The Mirror add that Liverpool are keen to keep the deal at a low sum with Shaqiri only seen as an alternative to Salah and Mane out wide as opposed to a first-choice option. Liverpool suffered at times last season with a lack of replacements in wide positions, as highlighted in their Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid when Salah went off injured and could only be replaced by Adam Lallana.

Klopp is said to still view Fekir as his ideal No 10 and Ligue 1 side Lyon have already looked at restructuring the deal to suit Liverpool's concerns over the player's health.

Willian, along with Chelsea's Belgium duo Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois, has not travelled to Australia as he takes some time off after the World Cup. The forward was voted the Chelsea players' player of the season last term but was believed to be unhappy playing under former Blues boss Antonio Conte and he was left out of the starting line-up for the 1-0 FA Cup final win over Manchester United in May. Jose Mourinho is interested in Willian, with United understood to have been keeping tabs on the situation since the end of last season. Barcelona have made the more recent running, however, although they continue to be frustrated in their pursuit of a player who has scored 44 goals in 236 appearances for Chelsea since joining the club from Russian side Anzhi in 2013.",FALSE

United boss Jose Mourinho is also believed to be interested in reuniting with Willian however there has been no bid made from Manchester. And Barcelona look to have made another step to get their man with Sky Sports reporting they have made a bid up to ¬£53m for Willian. It's also understood that Nou Camp chiefs began their pursuit of Willian up to three months ago. Barcelona lost Andres Iniesta this summer and are looking to bolster their attacking threat despite winning La Liga. Meanwhile, speaking last year, Willian gushed over Mourinho for the trust showed in him while the Portuguese boss was in charge of Chelsea. ""There were a few conversations with my agent. I worked with Mourinho and I became his friend as well,"" he said. ""He likes me a lot and I like him a lot as a coach and as a person. ""He has put his trust in me and in my work, and I was very grateful to him. ""Manchester came to me, they talked with my agent, but nothing happened, because Chelsea would not negotiate me in any way and I'm very happy at Chelsea.""

443,Barcelona lodge ¬£53million transfer offer for Chelsea attacker Willian,"Barcelona have reportedly submitted a second transfer bid for Chelsea attacker Willian. Chelsea rejected a ¬£50million offer, but Barcelona have now returned with an improved bid. Manchester United want to sign Willian and reunite the Brazilian with Jose Mourinho, but hopes seem to be fading after Barcelona stepped up their pursuit. Sky Sports claim Barcelona have lodged a ¬£52m bid and talks will continue between both clubs. Willian prefers a move to Barcelona over a switch within the Premier League and the player's wishes may be key to the outcome of United's efforts to land the forward. United have been tracking Willian since January, while Barcelona first made contact with Chelsea three months ago. Willian is free to resolve his club future after Brazil's exit from the World Cup in Russia. Brazil were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Belgium, but Willian's performances at the tournament did not go unnoticed. Mourinho kept a close eye on proceedings in Russia working as an analyst for Russia Today, before returning to Carrington to kick off United's pre-season this week. Chelsea too have begun their preparations for the new season, but Willian has been given extra time off after his World Cup exploits. Barcelona's and United's efforts to sign Willian may be complicated by the impending appointment of Maurizio Sarri as the Blues' new head coach. Sarri is set to replace the sacked Antonio Conte, and has reportedly told Chelsea Willian is not to be sold under any circumstances.

444,Barcelona submit third bid of ¬£55m for Chelsea star Willian,"Barcelona have reportedly placed a third bid of around ¬£55million for Chelsea winger Willian. The La Liga giants have had two bids rejected this summer for the Brazil star as Maurizio Sarri is keen to keep the 29-year-old. Barcelona's first bid of ¬£50m was followed up with another of around ¬£53m but the Spaniards hope to finally land the winger with a bid in the region of ¬£55m, according to Sky Sports . Manchester United are interested in Willian and could match the sums on offer from Barcelona but Chelsea would rather sell the winger abroad if they were to let him go. Willian was determined to leave Stamford Bridge had Antonio Conte stayed in west London but the club hoped Sarri's arrival would persuade him to stay. The Brazil international remains on holiday after Brazil's quarter-final exit from the World Cup and Sarri admitted in his first press conference for the club that he will wait to speak to players in person before deciding their futures. Should Chelsea allow Willian to leave, they will push to sign former Liverpool target Nabil Fekir. The Frenchman passed a medical to join the Reds in July but Liverpool attempted to renegotiate a fee after having concerns about the forward's knee. Willian's departure would possibly increase the chances of Eden Hazard staying at the club with the Blues prepared to reject advances from Real Madrid.",FALSE

It is said that Jose Mourinho's side are set to bid ¬£30m for the 23-year-old and are hopeful of securing his signature.

I'm 23 years old and have a lot of football left to play."" United have been forced into a transfer rethink after failing to land Maguire and Alderweireld. Leicester have been demanding ¬£65m for their England centre-back while Tottenham have stood firm in any negotiations over their man. Mina only joined Barcelona in January and made just five La Liga appearances last season. He is under contract at the Nou Camp until June 2023. The defender enjoyed a fine World Cup in Russia earlier this summer, scoring three times as Colombia reached the last 16. He netted against England in the knockout stages but couldn't stop them exiting the tournament as the Three Lions claimed penalty shoot-out glory. Amid the speculation surrounding Mina, Mourinho said earlier this week that he is optimistic of welcoming one more new star to Old Trafford before the window closes. United have signed three new players so far this summer and the Special One is desperate for further reinforcements. He said: ""I am confident I will get one, but I think two I am not going to get - which is not a drama. ""In every pre-season it happens the same, with every club, which is that the manager wants more. ""It's our nature, you always want more for your team, but then club decisions are different and normally you don't get what you want, which happened during all my career.

Although manager Jose Mourinho had wanted to sign another left back this summer, he has decided that position is no longer a priority to fill, which means Luke Shaw has gained another reprieve and will almost certainly remain at Old Trafford for at least another season. Shaw appears to have worked hard on his fitness over the summer and has always maintained he wants to fight for his place rather than quit the club. Shaw only has on year remaining on his contract and will be able to leave on a lucrative free transfer at the end of the season. With less than three weeks to go until the window is shut, United will focus on the need for another centre-back and Maguire's impressive form at the World Cup has pushed him to the top of their wanted list. Maguire only signed for Leicester 12 months ago in a ¬£17.5m switch from Hull City, but could well be on the move again after he was such a key part of England's success under Gareth Southgate in Russia. C lubs across Europe have all taken notice of his ability, not just as a defender, but one who is comfortable enough on the ball to dribble out of defence and pick a forward pass. Whether United can do enough to persuade Leicester to sell remains to be seen. It would take a bid well in excess of ¬£50m for them to even consider letting him go. The 25-year-old still has four years remaining on the contract he signed last summer and Leicester have already indicated they would like to renegotiate better terms to extend it, with suggestions they will raise his weekly wage to around ¬£80,000. Whether they can match the sort of deal United are able to offer is doubtful, but Maguire is happy at the club and does not seem to be the type of character who will agitate to leave, particularly when there is so little time left in this window. U nited could revive their interest in Belgium international Toby Alderweireld, but they are all too aware of how difficult it can be to deal with Tottenham Hotspur chairmen Daniel Levy, particularly when they have made it clear they do not want to allow Spurs' target Anthony Martial to leave for London in this window. The Martial situation is an intriguing stand-off. As reported by Telegraph Sport on Sunday, the player remains keen to leave, but United do not want to risk losing him, only to then watch him thrive at another English club. They are expected to activate a clause in his contract that will extend it by another 12 months, giving them more power to keep him as he will not be allowed to leave on a Bosman at the end of the campaign. Tottenham, though, still feel they may be able to get a deal done for the 22-year-old France international, whose poor form at United cost him a place at the World Cup. It is a transfer that will bubble away right up until deadline day. Mourinho's decision on not needing to sign another full back is slightly surprising given that was his intention back in May. United have already signed one full back in this window, with Diogo Dalot arriving from Porto for ¬£19m. Although ostensibly a right-back, the 19-year-old is versatile enough to play on either flank. Dalot, though, will miss the start of the season with a knee injury that is likely to sideline him until September. T hat will make things hard for a teenager, in his first year in England, as he will have missed all of pre-season training. Perhaps Mourinho's thinking has been changed by the emergence of Demitri Mitchell. The 21-year-old Academy graduate started United's first game on their USA tour against Club America following a successful loan spell at Hearts in Scotland. Mitchell can play as either a traditional left back or as a more attacking wing back and is determined to prove his worth in pre-season rather than go out on loan again. If Mourinho feels he has done enough to earn a place in the squad next term, that would leave him with Ashley Young and Shaw as senior players to fill the left back berth, with Mitchell as cover. Dalot would also be an option when he returns to full fitness, even though he was signed with a view to becoming Antonio Valencia's long-term successor at right back.",FALSE
465,Leicester to Reportedly Offer Harry Maguire New Deal Amid Man United Rumours,"Leicester City are reportedly ready to offer Harry Maguire a new contract after blocking a potential move to Manchester United . According to Dave Armitage of the Daily Mirror , a switch to Old Trafford represents a ""dream move"" for Maguire and United were ready to spend a whopping ¬£65 million to bring in the England international. However, Leicester are said to be ready to dig their heels in and keep Maguire, who starred for England at the FIFA World Cup in Russia, unless they receive a bid of ¬£80 million. They will also reportedly hand him a new contract. ""Leicester are poised to slap a ¬£95,000 a week new deal in front of the 25-year-old‚Äîalmost doubling his current ¬£50,000 a week wages,"" said Armitage. ""That ¬£45,000 hike spread over four years means Maguire stands to haul in an extra ¬£9.36m on the back of his Russian exploits and United's interest."" It's added that agreeing to those terms would make Maguire the second-highest earner at Leicester after Jamie Vardy. The club's owners are said to be keen to make a stand in the transfer window after Manchester City 's prolonged and eventually successful pursuit of Riyad Mahrez: If Manchester United want Maguire, it's gonna cost them üí∞ https://t.co/aENfBbUO2L The new contract on the table for Maguire comes just a year after he actually signed for Leicester from Hull City , during which time he's made major progress. Maguire won the club's Player of the Year prize after settling in quickly at the heart of the defence. The 25-year-old was wonderful to watch, as he defended with commitment and aggression, showcasing a fair degree of leadership in his play too. The England man is also excellent in possession, whether that be passing out from the back or setting off on what have become trademark dribbles forward to get attacks started. The interest from United is not a surprise as a result, and Rob Blanchette believes they will ultimately get their man if they are serious about signing Maguire: If #MUFC really want Maguire and Alderweireld - they will get them both. Wages won't be an issue. Yes, Leicester won't want to sell. But Spurs know it's a last chance to cash-in on a player running his deal out. As I always say, transfer fees don't interest me. Sign them now. Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho does have some big decisions to make in central defence. With Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Victor Lindelof, Eric Bailly and Marcos Rojo all available, the coach isn't short of numbers in the position, although each of the five players named has his issues to contend with. Football journalist Tom Williams doesn't think adding Maguire would necessarily be an antidote to those problems: Man United have five centre-backs (Smalling, Jones, Bailly, Rojo, Lindelof) who all need to play alongside a senior centre-back who knows what he's doing. If they buy Harry Maguire, they'll have six. Even so, Leicester's determination to keep their star defender is understandable. Not only would he be a difficult man to replace, with the transfer window closing prior to the start of the Premier League season, time is at a premium to get fresh faces through the door. Maguire may be disappointed if the move doesn't come off, as his stock is currently sky-high following a fine World Cup. However, a new contract with Leicester should ensure he's focused for 2018-19 and ready for another excellent campaign.",FALSE

467,"Eden Hazard move to Real Madrid 'almost inevitable', says World Cup Supplement panellist Andy Dunn","Chelsea forward Eden Hazard's move to Real Madrid is ""almost inevitable"", says World Cup Supplement panellist Andy Dunn. Following Belgium's 2-0 win against England in the World Cup third-place play-off game, Hazard said that he could be ready to leave Chelsea for a new challenge . He also said that people would already know his preferred destination - thought to be Real Madrid - and Dunn thinks it increasingly likely that the move will happen. ""I find it almost inevitable,"" the Mirror's chief sports writer told the World Cup Supplement podcast. ""Look how one of the best players at this World Cup, Luka Modric, has developed since he went to Real Madrid. He was a great player when he was with Spurs but he's a class above that now because he's playing with the best players in the world in a team that dominates the Champions League. ""Why wouldn't Eden Hazard want to play for Real Madrid? Now there is an opening with Cristiano Ronaldo leaving and he's quite right that he's had six years at Chelsea where he's been excellent. Neil Ashton is joined by Andy Dunn and Henry Winter in the latest World Cup Supplement podcast. ""On top of that, he's having to go through another change of manager. In his quotes, I did get the impression that he wasn't overly enamoured that they had changed Antonio Conte for Maurizio Sarri and he paid tribute to Conte. His point of view will be that they're changing manager all the time, so how about a new challenge for me? I would fully understand it. ""From Sarri and Chelsea's point of view, the new manager is coming in and losing a player of that quality. We saw against England that he was the man of the match and outstanding again - he is everything Raheem Sterling should be for England. ""It would be a devastating blow for Chelsea, although in theory they hold the cards because he has two years left on his contract, but I think it will happen."" His sentiments were echoed by The Times' chief football writer Henry Winter, who believes Hazard will answer if Real Madrid come calling. The playmaker has been superb for Belgium at the World Cup ""The fact that the last sentence in his quote was 'and you know where that is', it was basically saying this is the pecking order,"" he said. ""In a way, it's almost nothing to do with a change in management at Chelsea, although I do take the point that Conte created this platform with a system which allowed Hazard to flourish. But it is Real Madrid, and when Real Madrid come calling - we saw it with the likes of David Beckham and Gareth Bale - they are an absolutely iconic club and you can see Hazard going there and slotting in. ""You can see him playing in games where he's not being kicked on a regular basis. I have huge admiration for him as a footballer but also his character as well because we've seen so many games where this has happened and maybe he feels like he has given his due in the trenches of the Premier League.

He has only a year left on his contract, knows he is in a strong bargaining position and even hinted he could see out the final season on his deal and leave as a free agent next summer. Asked if he was coming back to Chelsea: ""I will be coming back, for sure, and I will see what they want and how they say it. Obviously with this World Cup, I think what was on the table obviously is different than what I can have, maybe. ""People always complain that players don't comply with their contracts, but maybe they do. I don't think they will keep someone with my qualities on the bench, even if I don't sign a new contract. But maybe staying is possible, because I like it in London. ""In this World Cup, I have ignored all the speculation, all the rumours but now in the next few days I will have a chat with my agent and see what Chelsea told him, and then we will talk. But I feel happy at Chelsea, it's not that I necessarily want to leave."" Asked about Hazard's comments about leaving, Courtois he joked: ""Wherever I go Eden must come along. We will not let each other go. But first a vacation."" Courtois wasn't surprised Chelsea finally sacked Antonio Conte and replaced him with Napoli boss Maurizio Sarri because he and his team-mates had already been told by the Stamford Bridge hierarchy that there would be a managerial change. His only surprise was how long it took and believes the delay hasn't done Sarri any favours in terms of preparation for the new season. He added: ""It's hard to talk about it because I don't know exactly what happened. But the decision that was made a few days ago, I think as a group we expected that to happen a long time ago because we heard what the board said to us after the season ended and then it takes until now. ""I don't think it's easy for a new manager to come in and shape us in a few weeks. I think fans need to understand we will need some time to adapt to the new manager and a different style. My Belgium team-mate Dries Mertens plays for Napoli and he told me good things about Sarri, so I'm looking forward to coming back and winning some prizes."" Courtois, who was criticised at times last season, believes he has silenced his detractors with his displays in the World Cup which have made him a contender for best goalkeeper in the tournament. ""I'm very happy with the team performance and I'm very happy with my own performance,"" he said. ""I know this is my level, despite people called me a bad goalkeeper but I think I proved a lot of people wrong and I know this is my level. ""Sometimes during a season, you can have bad luck. I remember at one time, I had made only 50 per cent saving rate but that's maybe because some goals are unsavable and people get blinded by statistics. ""The last one and a half months at Chelsea, I performed at a high level and I felt I took this form with me and played a really good World Cup. To call me the best in the world, I don't know. Jordan [Pickford] made some good saves against Sweden and Colombia, and Hugo Lloris made a very good save against us in the semi-final and also against Uruguay. ""But I don't think you can decide on the amount of saves, I think if you did then I exceed everyone. But sometimes it's just that one save that does it. The keeper I mentioned, Danijel Subasic of Croatia, as well, maybe all four were on a high level. That's how you take a team to the highest level."" Courtois doesn't regret beating England in the final group game which ensured they played in a tougher side of the draw in the knock-out stages ‚Äì they beat Brazil in the quarter-finals but lost to France in the last four. ""No, because I felt we had to win every game and we did everything to go as far as possible, and we didn't feel we had to lose that game. We felt proud because we beat Brazil and showed everyone what is Belgium. ""It's a pity we lost against France, but I didn't feel we were any worse than France and that we could have beaten them as well. ""But that's how some teams feel against Chelsea - you have the ball, you feel you are better than them but one set play or penalty decides it and that's how it was. We were just upset because we lost the semi-final, not because we were in the wrong side of the draw.""",TRUE

481,Harry Maguire to Man Utd: Leicester open contract talks and will demand huge transfer fee,"Maguire has enjoyed a summer to remember with England at the World Cup, excelling on the international stage and helping his country to the semi-finals. His displays in Russia have inevitably lead to interest with Leicester's Premier League rivals keen. The Daily Mail report that Jose Mourinho's United are considering a ¬£50m approach for the 25-year-old while Spurs remain interested despite failing to land him last summer. It is said that Leicester have responded to the transfer activity by preparing a new deal for their star defender. The Foxes are looking to tie down Maguire's future by opening talks over a new ¬£75,000-a-week contract. Claude Puel's side have no intention of selling the ex-Hull man and are willing to make him one of their top earners. Riyad Mahrez's recent move to Manchester City has freed up some space on their wage bill and a hefty chuck of that could now go to keeping Maguire. It waits to be seen if United or Tottenham would be willing to offer the centre-back more cash. Another problems for Maguire's potential suitors lies in Leicester's valuation. The Daily Mail add that bosses at the King Power Stadium believe their prized assets is worth similar to the ¬£75m Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk in January. Maguire's future will not be resolved any time soon as he remains in Russia with England. He will likely start the Three Lions' third-place play-off tie against Belgium in Saint Petersburg tomorrow afternoon.",TRUE
482,"Man Utd transfer news LIVE: Pogba MEETS Barcelona in USA, Mourinho to complete deal","Manchester United Transfer News LIVE - All the latest gossip and updates from Old Trafford Wednesday, August 1 Barcelona technical secretary Eric Abidal has reportedly denied holding a meeting with Manchester United star Paul Pogba about a summer move. Barcelona have also been keeping close tabs on the World Cup winner's situation as they seek to fill the void left behind by the departures of Paulinho and Andres Iniesta. Reports on Wednesday suggested that Pogba had met with Abidal in Beverley Hills, LA. But according to Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo, Abidal denies suggestions he met with the midfielder. It is reported that Barca will approach United directly should they wish to sign Pogba. Manchester United have sent their chief negotiator to Spain to push through a move for Barcelona defender Yerry Mina, reports claim. United have made their priority to sign a centre-half. Leicester's Harry Maguire had been a top target, but United's interest appears to have cooled and so they have turned to Mina. Everton are also tracking the 23-year-old, but United are supposedly closer to striking a deal. The Sun claim that United's chief negotiator Matt Judge has jetted out to Barcelona to try and seal a deal for Mina. It is also suggested that Barca are willing to lower their initial ¬£44million valuation of Mina. This is the moment Ed Woodward chased after Jose Mourinho before the pair exchanged a handshake on their US tour. Footage has emerged of Woodward shuffling through the mixed zone after Manchester United's 2-1 win over Real Madrid in pre-season. The executive vice-chairman made a beeline for United boss Mourinho, who he gave a warm handshake to. They then exchanged words for 20 seconds before Mourinho walked off after Woodward patted him on the shoulder. Mourinho revealed this week that he gave Woodward a list of ""five names a few months ago"" and is now playing the waiting game as the deadline creeps closer. Paul Pogba has reportedly met Barcelona director Eric Abidal in a villa in Beverly Hills. Manchester United are not open to selling Pogba right now despite his mixed two seasons back at Old Trafford. The midfielder is said to have met Abidal in secret, adding mystery as to why the pair got together. Barcelona have already signed two midfielders this summer and a third in the shape of Pogba seems unlikely. However, the report from Tuttosport claims that the meeting was done specifically in private as Abidal did not want to be seen in public with a player under contract at another club. Diogo Dalot's Manchester United shirt number appears to have been leaked by goalkeeper Joel Pereira. The defender is yet to feature for the Red Devils in pre-season so far having undergone knee surgery shortly after arriving at Old Trafford. However, Dalot is expected to return to full fitness in September having just resumed training with his new club. Fellow new signing Fred has revealed he will wear the No 17 shirt this term but there's been no official confirmation about Dalot's number. But it seems shot-stopper Pereira has revealed Dalot will wear No 20. In a snap uploaded to his Instagram story, Pereira showed Dalot wearing the No 20 shirt with the caption: ""Soon on the pitch. Baller."" Everton have been told to ""stay away"" from Marcos Rojo amid reports they are linked with a ¬£30million move for the Manchester United defender. Everton fan and ESPN FC presenter Ross Dyer was not happy with the rumours when discussing it with former West Ham goalkeeper Shaka Hislop. ""The Argentine defender Rojo to Everton as Man United look for an actual central defender who can defend,"" Dyer said. ""Rojo to Everton, a price of ¬£30m?"" Hislop replied to the Toffees supporter: ""Well, I should be asking you about this, Ross."" And Dyer says Everton should steer clear of Rojo, who has spent the last four seasons at United. ""I'd say no! Stay away,"" he exclaimed. Hislop agreed on the ESPN FC transfer rater. ""I'll follow your lead. It makes absolutely no sense to me either,"" the pundit concluded. Jose Mourinho has reportedly been left upset as Manchester United failed to acquire two signings this summer. Mourinho has brought three players to Old Trafford this summer with Diogo Dalot, Fred and Lee Grant all arriving. But the Portuguese boss has admitted he's disappointed in the transfer dealings his board have made. He recently said: ""I gave a list of five players who interest me to the club and I hope we'll get at least one. ""But if it is not possible, then we'll continue fighting, working and believing in those we have."" And Marca now report that Real Madrid duo Gareth Bale and Toni Kroos were two that were on Mourinho's wanted list. Manchester United have reportedly been offered the chance to sign Axel Witsel. The Belgium star wants to leave the Chinese Super League behind. And Bild say United have been offered him by the player's club, Tianjin Quanjin. Lee Grant insists Jose Mourinho has been nothing but 'positive' after their pre-season defeat to Liverpool. Mourinho said in his post-match press conference that he wasn't worried as he was without a number of his key players. But goalkeeper Grant, one of three new arrivals at Old Trafford, says Mourinho has sent positive vibes throughout the United camp. ""What we're getting from inside the camp has been nothing but positive,"" Grant told Sky Sports. ""He's come in even after the Liverpool game and spoken very highly of what we've have given as a team and as a unit. ""The messages we are getting from the manager are positive ones and that is important for us going forward. His attitude and demeanour around the place is great and that is helpful for us especially when we are under-manned and we are working our hardest."" Jose Mourinho has been warned against signing Harry Maguire this summer by transfer expert Raphael Honigstein. Manchester United have been heavily linked with a move for the Leicester star after he enjoyed an impressive World Cup for England. Maguire has been priced up at around ¬£70m by the Foxes. But Honigstein has warned the Portuguese coach against signing Maguire this summer. ""A lot of money for someone who I don't think looks comfortable on the ball,"" he told ESPN FC. ""Yes he can play but he's not John Stones. ""You can say Jose might not want his centre-backs to be quite as much on the ball. But I think in today's game it's difficult if your guy with the ball doesn't know how to play from the back."" Chris Smalling could be heading to newly promoted Wolves, according to the bookies. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has made no secret of his desire to bring in a new centre-back this summer. The Red Devils are reportedly in talks with Leicester over a big-money move for Harry Maguire, which would likely see a defender leave Old Trafford. And according to bookmakers Betfair, Smalling could be the one to be offloaded despite reports suggesting it would be Marcos Rojo. Betfair have slashed Smalling's odds to join Wolves from 33/1 to evens. Chelsea and Manchester United transfer target Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is not for sale, according to Lazio president Claudio Lotito. The Serb has been heavily linked with a move to some of Europe's biggest clubs after an impressive season in Serie A. Chelsea and Manchester United are two of the sides who have an expressed an interest in Milinkovic-Savic this summer. But Lazio are not willing to sell their star man at any price before next month's transfer deadline. ""I did not put on sale Milinkovic, as in all things, absurd offers will be evaluated, in the exclusive interest of the club,"" Lotito told RMC Sport. ""However, I have not ever perceived an emolument, unlike many other colleagues of mine."" Javier Ribalta has been confirmed as Zenit St Petersburg's sporting director after a year as Manchester United's chief scout. The 37-year-old moved to Old Trafford last summer after impressing with his work during a five-year stint at Juventus. Ribalta worked alongside chief scouts Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout at United, but he has now moved onto Russia to join giants Zenit. ""I've been working in football for many years and spent a long time at Juventus and have worked with other Italian clubs, Novara and Torino,"" Ribalta said. ""I also spent last year at Manchester United, after many years at Juventus I decided to go there for a challenge. When this proposal from Zenit came I have no doubts, because Zenit is really a very big name and a very large club."" Manchester United are nowhere near good enough to challenge for the Premier League title, says former Liverpool man Charlie Adam. Asked on BBC Radio 5Live how many more new signings Mourinho needs, Adam replied: ""Five, easily. ""They need a new left-back, a centre-half, a holding a midfielder. They need to get the best out of Alexis Sanchez somehow. Do they need to get another behind Romelu Lukaku?"" Adam was more positive about Liverpool's prospects, especially with Alisson, Naby Keita, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri arriving this summer. ""Liverpool are one or two players from the title,"" Adam added. ""Jurgen Klopp has added quality to the squad, I still think they could do with another centre-half. ""Alisson is going to be worth six to eight points over the season. It adds a total belief and confidence."" Manchester United can make one last play for Gareth Bale. That's according to the Manchester Evening News, who suggest manager Jose Mourinho could use tonight's pre-season clash to lure to Wales international to Old Trafford. The Red Devils go head-to-head with Real Madrid in the early hours of Wednesday morning in the International Champions Cup. The MEN refer to last summer's meeting between these two sides when Mourinho cheekily said: ""I can't buy you because you do not talk up!"" It remains to be seen whether Mourinho will stoke the fire, but circumstances are different with Julen Lopetegui at the helm. He's expected to give Bale more first-team action after the departure of Gareth Bale. Jose Mourinho may be displaying a totally different outlook behind closed doors ahead of the new Premier League season, according to Sky Sports pundit Clinton Morrison. The Portuguese coach has bemoaned missing a host of his players due to the World Cup and lambasted club officials for not backing him in the transfer market. But Morrison believes the Manchester United boss may be fooling the media with his negative attitude this summer. ""He [Mourinho] might be so frustrated with the media but in the changing room he might be saying something totally different to his players,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""As Lee Grant said, and I know Granty, he would be telling the truth, it looks like from the outside it is not a happy camp but from the inside it might be a very happy camp. ""He's been very frustrated, Jose Mourinho. Over the last few years, it has gotten worse and worse. He looks like he hardly wants to speak to the media."" Yahoo Sport claim Jose Mourinho would rather sign Colombia international Yerry Mina, 23, over England's World Cup hero Harry Maguire. They say United see the Barcelona ace as a more economic alternative to Maguire, with Leicester demanding around ¬£75m for the former Hull defender. Toby Alderweireld is also on Mourinho's summer wishlist, however, United and Tottenham are way apart in their valuation of the Belgium international, 29. Yahoo add that United are keen to offload at least one centre-back to make room for Mina. Marcos Rojo seems the most likely to leave Old Trafford, with Everton and Wolves eyeing late moves for the Argentina international. Wolfsburg are interested in signing Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw. The former Southampton full-back has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford and will be free to talk to foreign clubs in January. The Daily Mail claim Wolfsburg want to lure Shaw, 23, to the Bundesliga. And they've been given a glimmer of hope after Shaw announced that he would not sign a new contract until he feels that he's earned it. Willian is set to report back to Chelsea tomorrow as speculation over his future continues. Willian has yet to return to pre-season following the World Cup but reports have suggested he was expected to be back already. The Times claim he was expected back in London last Friday but is still yet to appear at Cobham. And now Sky Sports are saying that he will return tomorrow when he is expected to hold talks with the club over his future. Willian has been linked with both Manchester United and Barcelona, but the Spanish champions have since snapped up Malcom after seeing two bids knocked back. United are still in the hunt for a winger but yesterday Willian claimed he was happy at Chelsea. Manchester United are odds-on to sign Barcelona centre-back Yerry Mina this summer, the bookies claim. Jose Mourinho is keen to splash the cash before the transfer window shuts on August 9. And according to the bookies, Colombia international Mina, who impressed at the World Cup in Russia this summer, is likely to head to Old Trafford before the window slams shut. Betway's Alan Alger said: ""Harry Maguire had appeared to be Jose Mourinho's number one defensive transfer target, but with a move now looking unlikely at 7/4, his attentions seem to have turned to Barcelona defender Yerry Mina. ""The Colombian impressed many at the World Cup scoring three times and he's now odds-on at 8/11 to be Manchester United's fourth summer recruit. Everton are thought to be in the market for a centre back and they come next in the betting at 5/4.""",FALSE
483,Barcelona insider reveals Chelsea transfer deal: 'He will go to Real Madrid',"Barcelona are one of several clubs linked with a move for the Chelsea midfielder following his impressive displays at the World Cup. With the Blues without Champions League football this season, a host of stars are set to receive attractive proposals from European clubs. Kante is attracting interest from Barcelona, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. But it seems Ernesto Valverde's side have already conceded defeat in the chase, according to a well-placed source at the club. A high level Barca source told Spanish publication AS : ""He is very good, he would bring us a lot, but he will end up in Madrid or PSG. ""We cannot do anything about it."" With the big clubs set to come knocking, Express Sport understands the Blues are trying to tie the Frenchman down to a new deal. The 27-year-old still has three years left on his original contract, but Chelsea want to tie him down to a new five year contract, making him one of the best paid players at the club and securing his long-term future. Chelsea have now opened talks with his representatives and are prepared to offer him around ¬£200,000 a week. The Blues have been quiet in the transfer window so far with Antonio Conte's future still in doubt.

484,Real Madrid 'agree' ¬£31m Thibaut Courtois deal: Eden Hazard has verbal agreement too,"French outlet RMC Sport claim the two clubs have settled on a fee. And the Belgium international, who was awarded the Golden Glove at the World Cup, will apparently head to the Bernabeu on a four-year deal. Courtois has just one year remaining on his current Chelsea contract. No new deal appears likely with the 26-year-old former Atletico Madrid shot-stopper keen to return to Spain's capital. As the Blues face losing their star keeper for free in 2019, it means Real do not have to pay over the odds this summer. A ¬£31m deal is said to have been agreed, and Courtois could be joined by international and club team-mate Eden Hazard at Real. RMC Sport add the European champions are also pursuing Chelsea's talented forward following Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Juventus. And there is claimed to be a verbal agreement between Hazard and Real chiefs he would sign too. There is no fee sorted between Chelsea and Real at this stage, though. But Hazard's wish is to head for the Bernabeu, where he could well team up with Courtois for the 2019/19 campaign. It is unclear who Chelsea could replace Courtois with, as top target Alisson may be moving to Liverpool instead from Roma. The Blues' Premier League rivals have today bid ¬£62m for Alisson, meaning Chelsea will have to act fast if they want to lure Brazil's No.1 to Stamford Bridge. For Hazard, meanwhile, Maurizio Sarri's side will no doubt hold out for a huge fee, despite Real's interest.",FALSE
485,Eden Hazard reaches verbal agreement with Real Madrid as he pushes for Chelsea exit,"Eden Hazard wants to leave Chelsea this summer and has reached a verbal agreement with Real Madrid, according to reports in France. After an impressive World Cup campaign with Belgium, the 27-year-old's future at Stamford Bridge remains uncertain ahead of the new season. Following Belgium's win over England in their third-place playoff, Hazard gave a clear indication that he is aiming to leave Chelsea. 'After six wonderful years at Chelsea it might be time to discover something different,' said the midfielder. 'Certainly after this World Cup. I can decide if I want to stay or go, but Chelsea will make the final decision ‚Äì if they want to let me go. You know my preferred destination.' According to RMC Sport , Real Madrid are actively looking to sign Hazard this summer. And the report claims that the Belgian already has a verbal agreement in place with the Spanish club's management. Madrid, however, have not yet agreed a fee with Chelsea. The midfielder still has two years remaining on his contract but his value will drastically reduce if he fails to sign a new deal and remains at Stamford Bridge for another season. Last week, reports claimed that Chelsea will demand at least ¬£200 million from Madrid for Hazard .

When asked about his future during Belgium's World Cup campaign , Courtois stressed that his children, who both live in Madrid, will be a factor behind his decision whether to remain at Chelsea. 'The only thing I've always said is that after the World Cup I look at everything,' the goalkeeper said earlier this month. 'The only thing is that my children are the most important and I'll make the decision that best suits me for everything.' According to RMC Sport , Courtois is now closing in on a move to Real Madrid as an agreement over a transfer fee has been reached with Chelsea. The Champions League holders will pay Chelsea ‚Ç¨35m (¬£31m) and have offered the 26-year-old a four-year contract.

487,Chelsea transfer news: Real Madrid stumped over Thibaut Courtois backlash,"Real Madrid are closing in on a deal to sign Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois. The La Liga giants are hoping a deal worth around ¬£35m will convince Chelsea to sell up. Courtois has only one year left on his Blues contract and has spoken positively about a move to Madrid. But his arrival at the Bernabeu will not go down well with Navas. The Costa Rican has played between the Real sticks ever since Iker Casillas left for Porto in 2015. Navas has since won three Champions League trophies with Real. And he is determined to remain their No 1 shot-stopper even if Courtois arrives this summer. According to Spanish newspaper AS, Navas will make life difficult for Real if they look to offload him. The club have already signed Andriy Lunin from Zorya Luhansk this summer and have Zinedine Zidane's son Luca plus Kiko Casilla on their books as well. Navas is tipped to be sold should Courtois arrive but the 31-year-old believes he deserves to keep his place. The player is under contract at Real until 2020 and he is keen to extend that deal, AS claim. As for Chelsea, they appear resigned to losing Courtois and have started the search for a replacement goalkeeper. Top target Alisson is set to join Liverpool from Roma in a ¬£66.8m deal. Petr Cech has been rumoured with a return from Arsenal, while AC Milan's Gianluigi Donnarumma is also supposedly on their list.",TRUE
488,Thibaut Courtois tells Chelsea to sell him now or he will walk away on free transfer next summer,"THIBAUT COURTOIS has told Chelsea he will not sign a new deal with the club and will walk away next summer on a free transfer unless they sell him in the next nine days. Chelsea are desperately trying to persuade Courtois to reject the advances of Real Madrid and commit his long term future to the club by agreeing a lucrative new contract. But the 26-year-old has informed the Blues he has no intention of penning a new deal and unless they let him leave this month he will see out the remaining 12 months of his contract and walk away for nothing. That leaves Chelsea with nine days to decide whether they are willing to write off ¬£35million by insisting he stays at Stamford Bridge this season. And SunSport understands part of the problem is the club do not want to spend more than ¬£20million on a new keeper ‚Äì leaving them scraping around the market for a cut price potential replacement for one of the most highly-rated stoppers in the game. New Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri says he wants the chance to speak face to face with Courtois in order to convince him West London is the best place for him to be for the next five years. But the keeper is not due back for pre-season training until next week, just two days before the transfer window in the Premier League shuts until January. And it is understood Courtois has already made it clear that nothing will change his mind and convince him to sign a new Chelsea deal, because he is set on moving to Madrid to be closer to his young family. Chelsea's struggles in the league last season and failure to qualify for the Champions League has been one of the things that has concerned the player. But deep down the main issue is he just wants to move back to Spain and live close to his two children who are being brought up in Madrid. Courtois wants to be close to them as soon as possible, ideally this summer, and the worst case scenario would be for him to wait a further year. But that is the final cut off point in his mind, and there appears nothing the Blues can do to change that position because the keeper just wants to live close to his kids. Yet unless they bring in a new keeper by deadline day on August 9, Chelsea will have little option than to keep Courtois and see him run down his contract. That would see them write off the ¬£35m Real are willing to pay to sign him, and also mean they would then have to fork out another sizeable sum next summer on a new number one. Yet so far Chelsea have let it be known then only want to pay ¬£15m-20m on a keeper this year, seriously reducing the amount of viable options for such a key position. Kasper Schmeichel has been a target but Leicester value him in excess of ¬£45m, while Stoke's Jack Butland would also be a long way out of reach at that money. So all of a sudden England reject Joe Hart has become one option, with Manchester City looking to offload him as he enters the last year of his own deal at the Etihad Stadium.",TRUE

Zinchenko, who can play as either a winger or a full-back, made 16 appearances for City last season including eight in the Premier League to allow him to collect a winner's medal. But despite a breakthrough season at the Etihad, City appear willing to let Zinchenko leave with Wolves ready to offer him more chances of first-team football. Any hopes he had of getting more playing time for Pep Guardiola's side were hit by the arrival of Riyad Mahrez from Leicester earlier in the window.

United have signed two players so far this summer ‚Äì with Diogo Dolot following Fred through the doors at Old Trafford ‚Äì but the club are being linked with a number of other moves. Mourinho signed Romelu Lukaku last summer and Alexis Sanchez in January but he remains interested in strengthening his attacking options. And the Portuguese manager is said to have expressed interest in signing Arnautovic, who he briefly worked with at Inter Milan. According to Austria outlet Osterreich , Mourinho has shared text messages with Arnautovic's brother and agent, Danijel. Last week, Arnautovic was asked about the interest from Manchester United and admitted he was flattered to be linked with the Premier League giants. 'It's nice to hear, I haven't heard anything from my brother, my agent,' he said. 'You can keep asking this question but you'll never hear the answer from me.' Arnautovic scored 12 goals in 38 games in all competitions last season and has the potential to succeed at United, according to Stuart Pearce.

The 29-year-old has had an impressive season with the London club and the Red Devils are reportedly ready to make a swoop for the ¬£50million rated Arnautovic this summer. The Austrian moved to the London Stadium from Stoke last summer for ¬£25million which would lead to a healthy profit for the Hammers. However, Arnautovic currently has four years left on his deal with the club, so there is no pressure for West Ham to sell.

501,Man Utd transfer news: Toby Alderweireld will reject other clubs if Spurs deny move,"The Belgium international is Jose Mourinho's top centre-back target but the Portuguese boss has apparently been priced out of a move and will instead look to Barcelona's Yerry Mina. Spurs have demanded ¬£75million for Alderweireld, while United would only pay around ¬£55m, despite the fact that his contract runs out in a year's time. There is an optional one-year extension included, although that would also activate a release clause worth just ¬£25m which could be triggered in the final two weeks of the 2019 summer window. The north London outfit are willing to consider offers for the defender, who fell out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino last term after returning from injury. But they will only consider bids that meet their valuation of the player, which would represent the joint-highest fee ever paid for a defender following Virgil van Dijk's ¬£75m switch from Southampton to Liverpool in January. And according to the Daily Mirror , such is Alderweireld's desire to move to Old Trafford that the 29-year-old will reject any other possible moves this summer and run down his deal at Spurs. Spurs and Alderweireld's representatives were well apart in contract negotiations next term with the player's party pushing for around ¬£50,000-a-week extra than on offer from the club. Alderweireld has been an important part of a solid Spurs rearguard in recent seasons since joining from Atletico Madrid - although Davinson Sanchez impressed in his first season in England last term and played ahead of Alderweireld in the latter stage of the campaign. Although he only made 14 top-flight run-outs in 2017-18, Alderweireld remains regarded as one of the best defenders in the division - such has been Mourinho's desire to sign him. The Red Devils had looked at Leicester City's Harry Maguire as an alternative option although the Foxes are reported to want a similar fee for the Englishman - who they signed for ¬£17m from Hull City just a year ago. Mina, valued at around ¬£35m, is thought to be the most likely to move to Old Trafford before next Thursday's transfer deadline. And ESPN FC pundit and former Arsenal striker Paul Mariner believes the towering Colombian would be the right addition - as long as he wants to leave the Nou Camp. Mariner said: ""It makes a lot of sense for Manchester United. I liked him at the World Cup, very dangerous in the box attacking-wise. ""I think he's what Manchester United need. Manchester United need a central defender, a towering defender who is going to go in there and impose himself. ""So, from Manchester United's viewpoint, yes [they should sign him].

502,"Report: Toby Alderweireld Set on Manchester United, Could See out Spurs Deal","Tottenham Hotspur defender Toby Alderweireld reportedly has his heart set on joining Manchester United and has decided he will remain with Spurs until the chance to join the Red Devils presents itself rather than move elsewhere. Per the Mirror 's Darren Lewis , United have been put off by Spurs' ¬£75 million price tag for the centre-back given he has less than a year remaining on his contract. Tottenham can extend it until 2020, but doing so would activate a clause that will make him available for ¬£25 million in the final two weeks of the 2019 summer transfer window. Such a price would likely be far more palatable at Old Trafford, but the Belgium international is also prepared to see out his deal with Spurs to get a free transfer to the Red Devils and ""snub"" other interested clubs in the meantime. The 29-year-old joined Spurs in 2015 and has established himself as perhaps the best centre-back in the Premier League in the years since. As such, it's natural Tottenham want to make as much as they can from a potential sale. But with time running out for the club to garner a significant fee for him, it seems they may consider lower offers: It's understood @SpursOfficial in the market for two players before window closes - club to consider any offers for Alderweireld, Rose and Dembele should they materialise. If that is the case, United may still make a move before the transfer window closes depending on how far Spurs are prepared to drop their valuation. Football writer Liam Canning believes the club should pursue him: Really like Harry Maguire, but Manchester United need a wise head in the centre of their defence. A player like Toby Alderweireld should always be the priority. He might be older, but Eric Bailly and Victor Lindel√∂f need that experience beside them. The Red Devils have conceded a combined 92 Premier League goals across the past three seasons ‚Äîfewer than any other club ‚Äîbut their defence does not always inspire confidence. Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof have plenty of potential, but neither is the finished package ‚Äîparticularly the latter ‚Äîwhile both Chris Smalling and Phil Jones are erratic. The biggest factor in their defensive record is probably David De Gea's presence, as he has bailed out his defenders on countless occasions. Adding Alderweireld to their ranks this summer would boost their chances of success in the forthcoming season, though their reluctance to splash out when he could be acquired relatively cheaply next year is understandable. As for Spurs, losing him for ¬£25 million or for free would be far from ideal given how valuable an asset he is, but they will at least get another year or two out of him in those cases and can take advantage of his presence in the meantime.",FALSE

But Zidane's surprise departure and the subsequent arrival of Lopetegui appears a significant blow to United's bid to sign Bale, who is preparing for his sixth season in the Spanish capital. L opetegui is understood to have told Bale how much he admires him, and how is he looking forward to working with him in the forthcoming campaign. R onaldo's sale to Juventus, which was confirmed last week, could also present Bale with the platform to become a central figure in Lopetegui's plans. Bale's representatives are expected to hold talks with the Real hierarchy later this week but, at this stage, a move to United appears remote. A fter the 3-1 win over Liverpool, Bale said: ""I need to be playing week in week out and that hasn't happen this season for one reason or another. ""I need to sit down in the summer and discus it with my agent and go from there.""",TRUE

The Wales international scored twice, including a stunning overhead kick, in their 3-1 Champions League final success over Liverpool , but his future in the Spanish capital remains unclear. ""Players always have something to prove but I think whatever he decides on, wherever his future is - and it could still be Real Madrid next season or it could be somewhere else - he's done a fantastic job with Madrid,"" Bale's former Wales manager Coleman told Sky Sports News.

Earlier this month, Steve Bruce exclusively told Sky Sports News selling players was ""inevitable"" due to ongoing financial problems at Villa, but added the ""obvious"" player he would not want to leave would be Grealish. ""We're up against it, let's be open and honest, we might have to make decisions that might not be easy, we have to generate some money,"" said Bruce. ""Inevitably that is going to be player sales. There are going to be people that I do not want to sell - and the obvious one is Jack [Grealish] - but people will know that we have got financial problems and they'll sit and wait, and wait, till Deadline Day possibly. ""I hope that doesn't happen but we've got to batten down the hatches and wait for it.""

With Villa in dire financial trouble after failing to gain promotion to the Premier League, their prized asset Grealish is expected to be sold this summer to raise funds. And the 22-year-old has gained the attention of a host of Premier League clubs, with Spurs looking to steal a march on their rivals. As first reported by Sky Sports News, Mauricio Pochettino is keen to bring the England Under-21 international to the club. Chelsea, Fulham and Leicester City are also understood to be monitoring Grealish's situation at Villa Park, with the club preparing for another season in the Championship. After beating Middlesbrough over two legs in the semi-finals, Steve Bruce's men were defeated 1-0 by Fulham in the Wembley showpiece. Despite an overall optimistic board meeting on Monday, the Villans are expected to sell their prized asset this summer. Grealish has two years left on his current deal and refused to sign a contract extension midway through last season. The creative midfielder made his debut for the club in May 2014 while they were still in the Premier League. After joining the Villans aged just six years old, he has gone on to make 92 appearances in total ‚Äì scoring six goals in the process.",FALSE
518,Tottenham transfer news: Aston Villa deal for Jack Grealish close with star expecting move,"Mauricio Pochettino's men have been linked with the 22-year-old for most of the summer but have so far been frustrated in their efforts. It had been reported that rivals Chelsea were looking to hijack Spurs in their pursuit of Grealish and Pochettino was lining up a bid for Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook instead. But now, according to the London Evening Standard , Spurs are still leading the race to sign the Villa star. Villa are thought to be likely to reject an opening bid of ¬£20million for the player but an agreement is still expected to be concluded before next week's transfer deadline. The Championship outfit were strapped for cash earlier in the summer with Grealish a certainty to be sold in a cut-price deal. Billionaire investment though in the form of Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens has since changed things, with the club now saved from falling into administration. Whilst players no longer need to be sold, the midfielder himself has indicated that he is interested in a move to Spurs and wants to test himself in the Premier League. The north London club are yet to make any signings so far in this summer's transfer window and are the only club in the top six yet to do business. Discussing their transfer plans on Wednesday, Pochettino said: ""I don't know if we are going to sign or not. We're working on that. ""I cannot tell you if we're going to sign one, zero, two or three or four.""

519,Tottenham transfer news: Real reason Jack Grealish move is OFF revealed,"Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was playing a waiting game with Aston Villa - only for the plan to backfire. Fierce negotiator Levy was trying to drive down the price knowing Villa's financial woes were there to be taken advantage of. But the move spectacularly flopped when Villa welcomed in new owners who blocked Grealish's exit. Egyptian billionaire Nassef Sawaris and American Wes Edens have a combined wealth of ¬£40bn - making them the third richest owners in English football. They have immediately pumped in cash to prevent Villa from falling into administration and have told Grealish he is staying. A Villa source said: ""Spurs could have pushed the button on this two weeks ago before the takeover. They didn't. And now the owners have said that neither he, nor James Chester, is going anywhere. ""They want to build Villa. That's not going to happen by selling the club's best players."" Mauricio Pochettino admitted Tottenham might not make any signings this summer after criticising the decision to close the transfer window early. Spurs, who traditionally do their business late, are the only club in the top six not to bring any fresh faces in so far and only have another eight days to do so before the window shuts on August 9. The decision to bring forward deadline day was voted on by Premier League clubs, who opted to shut the window before the season starts, although it remains open for the rest of Europe. And the fact Pochettino has failed to land any targets so far has done little to help his mood, with the Argentinian having already complained about the early start of the Premier League season after the World Cup. With just over a week to go, the boss does not know how many signings - if any - he will make. ""Last season I told you some numbers, but this season we don't know,"" Pochettino told several national newspapers ahead of his side's final friendly of their United States tour against AC Milan. ""I don't know if we are going to sign or not. We're working on that. I cannot tell you if we're going to sign one, zero or two or three or four. ""We're working. It's true that it's so close, the transfer window is so close, but the club's doing everything to help the team and add some players, more quality, and try to help us in the season to achieve what we want.""",FALSE

Reports last week claimed United are readying a ¬£35m bid for the defender ahead of the transfer deadline on August 9. And Mina, who joined Barca in the January transfer window, insists he's calm over his future. ""In terms of my future, I have no idea but I'm calm about it,"" Mina said to Bocas magazine .

On his turbulent spell at Barca, which saw the defender start just four La Liga games, Mina added: ""I thought a lot of things, a lot of bad things. I thought I was finished.

526,Everton Reportedly Close to Sealing ‚Ç¨24M Yerry Mina Transfer from Barcelona,"Everton are reportedly closing in on the signing of Barcelona centre-back Yerry Mina in a potential ‚Ç¨24 million (¬£21 million) switch. According to Ignasi Oliva Gispert of Goal, the Toffees are poised to sign the Colombia centre-back, who only joined the Blaugrana from Palmeiras in the January transfer window. ""With the expected arrival of Clement Lenglet from Sevilla and the established duo of Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti, Mina's prospects for minutes at Barcelona are dim,"" said Gispert, who added that Liverpool , West Ham United and Fenerbahce have also shown an interest in the 23-year-old. Everton director of football Marcel Brands reportedly met with Barcelona on Monday to discuss a possible switch. The defender is said to be keen to move to a team that will make him a key man, and Gispert has previously reported the Blaugrana are happy to sell the player if they can include a buyback option in any deal. Mina was part of the Colombia side at the FIFA World Cup this summer and made his mark with three goals in the tournament, providing a major threat from set pieces. As noted by OptaJavier, not many players have showcased this kind of aerial dominance on such a big stage: 3 - Yerry Minaüá®üá¥ is the first player to score three or more headed goals in a single #WorldCup since Miroslav Klose in 2002 (5). Hero. https://t.co/knqHVeGsBS When Mina arrived at Barcelona there was a lot of expectation, as he'd been impressive during his time in Brazil. Given his height, power and his obvious strength in the air, he can be a one-man wall when he's on his game. For Colombia alongside the dynamic Tottenham Hotspur centre-back Davinson Sanchez he was especially impressive. Still, when he was thrown into the team at Barcelona last season there were issues. He started just four league games for the Blaugrana and was particularly poor in the 5-4 loss to Levante , the only match Barcelona lost in the entire 2017-18 La Liga season. As noted by Rafael Hernandez of Grup14, he did at least enhance his reputation at the World Cup: I'm sad for Yerry Mina, he had a heroic performance and leaves as a hero. More to come! It would be intriguing to see him in the Premier League, as Mina boasts the physicality to cope with the aggressive nature of English football. The weaknesses in his game were exposed in the few appearances he had at Barca, though. Even so, football writer Jack Lusby feels as though the defender would be a good signing: If Everton are bidding ‚Ç¨24m for Yerry Mina I'd say #LFC should be too. https://t.co/nNFZ6XNPx1 Everton do need to strengthen their options at the back. While Mason Holgate is a fine prospect, Michael Keane struggled in his first season at the club, and although Phil Jagielka can still do a job, the Toffees skipper is 36 in August. Mina would provide strength, power and a threat from set pieces. Plus, with some stability and football on a weekly basis, those lapses that have punctured his game would surely lessen. The fact Barcelona are keen to include a buyback clause in the deal means they believe Mina could become a fine player in the future.",TRUE

Kovacic signalled his intention to leave the Santiago Bernabeu in June having grown frustrated with a lack of first-team opportunities under Zinedine Zidane. The midfielder started just 14 games in La Liga and the Champions League last season, insisting he was no longer 'happy' in the Spanish capital. Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have been credited with keen interest in the Croatia international along with Serie A trio Juventus, Roma and Inter Milan. Manchester City have also emerged as an interested party, but according to Sky Sports News are unwilling to meet Real's valuation for the player ‚Äì said to be ¬£80m.

After missing a penalty kick in the quarter-final shootout against Russia, he did not appear off the bench in either the semi-final clash with England or Sunday's final with France, with Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Marcelo Brozovic keeping him firmly out of the starting XI. Following a summer break, Kovacic is to return to Madrid having failed to truly showcase himself on the biggest stage.

Paul Hetherington of the Daily Star exclusively reported Los Blancos have informed City of their valuation and that they're not prepared to accept anything less. City are said to want Kovacic after they missed out on Jorginho, who joined Chelsea from Napoli on Saturday. The Croatian could feature in the World Cup final on Sunday, though during the tournament he has often been on the bench, with manager Zlatko Dalic instead preferring the trio of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Marcelo Brozovic. Despite the talent in front of him, Rory Smith of the New York Times has struggled to fathom why he has not been used more for his national side: I understand why Mateo Kovacic doesn't start for Croatia, but equally I do not understand *why* Mateo Kovacic doesn't start for Croatia. Kovacic has encountered a similar problem at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he's been behind Modric, Toni Kroos and Casemiro in the pecking order. The 24-year-old started just 21 of 36 appearances in all competitions last season and only completed 90 minutes seven times, three of which were in the Copa del Rey. A superb box-to-box player and all-rounder in midfield, he can pick out a pass, beat opponents on the dribble or reclaim possession. Managing Madrid's Kiyan Sobhani noted how difficult it is to win the ball cleanly off him, such is his technical ability: Sometimes I feel like the only way to stop Kovacic with the ball is to drive a train into him He rarely gives it away with a misplaced pass either, thanks to his unerring distribution: Mateo Kovacic has attempted 88 passes in 102 minutes at the 2018 World Cup, misplacing just two of them. 97.73% pass accuracy as it stands. https://t.co/xzsR0rYHgy Kovacic would fit in well at the Etihad Stadium under manager Pep Guardiola, but Real's determination to have their valuation met will likely prove off-putting for the Citizens . According to Stuart Brennan of the Manchester Evening News ‚Äî who reported City will not target an alternative to Jorginho ‚Äîthe Premier League champions would rather walk away from a transfer target than pay more than their own valuation.

Any transfer is sure to cost suitors more than that figure. Pogba has struggled to consistently perform at his best at Old Trafford. And his relationship with boss Jose Mourinho has been rocky over the last season with the Portuguese dropping his most expensive player on a number of occasions. Pogba was exceptional at the World Cup and scored for France in the 4-2 final win over Croatia . Mourinho called on his player to prove himself at club level as well. He said: ""I don't think it's about us getting the best out of him, it's about him giving the best he has to give."" Pogba ignored the United manager's plea for him to cut short his holiday and return for pre-season. Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard are also recharging after a hectic summer. Mourinho said: ""I just hope the boys on deserved holidays, they take care of themselves a little bit and somebody wants to do what Rashford and Jones do. ""Which is to be back a little bit earlier to try to help the team because for the beginning of the season we are going to be in trouble.""

Gomes has flopped at Bar√ßa since joining from Valencia two years ago - with his poor form seeing him miss out on Portugal's 2018 World Cup squad - and does not look to be in Blaugrana boss Ernesto Valverde's plans for next season . Having taken over from Ars√®ne Wenger this summer, Emery is busy remodelling the Gunners' squad in his image, and Gomes is not only seen as a good footballing fit, but is also thought to have earned positive character reviews in North London . However, the Premier League club are yet to table a formal offer . In what is a clear indication that Bar√ßa are preparing to offload Gomes this summer, the Barcelona-based newspaper Sport today revealed that the 24-year-old will not be a part of the club's pre-season tour of the United States . Fellow midfielder Paulinho's surprise return to Guangzhou Evergrande at the weekend had appeared to raise the possibility of room still being made for Gomes in next term's squad, but the Catalans are seemingly keen to cover the Brazilian's departure by signing Paris Saint-Germain's Adrien Rabiot .

Arsenal are unwilling to meet the Catalan club's valuation, per the report. The report also stated Barcelona are hopeful a deal can be completed by the end of the week, highlighting their eagerness to get this situation resolved. Gomes joined the club from Valencia amid much fanfare in 2016 after coming off a strong season with Los Che and an excellent showing during Portugal's run to the European title. Much was expected from the central midfielder, but his star quickly fell at the Camp Nou. He didn't feature much and played with a lack of confidence when he did get his chance. Last season brought no improvements, and toward the end of the campaign, he hinted at a transfer by describing his time with the club as ""a bit of a hell."" In an interview with Panenka (via Goal's Chris Burton ) he explained just how bad things had gotten for him: ""The first six months were pretty good but then things changed. ""Maybe it's not the correct word, but it turned into a bit of a hell, because I started to feel more pressure. With pressure I feel fine, but with pressure on myself, I don't. The feeling that I have during games is bad. [‚Ä¶] ""On more than one occasion, I didn't want to leave my house. Because people look at you, having the fear of going on the street out of shame.

But the England international remains their priority target and United have been boosted by suggestions the Foxes are preparing a bid for his replacement. According to The Sun , Leicester are willing to part with Maguire if they can snap up a suitable alternative. Claude Puel has identified Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles as his No.1 target and is reportedly plotting a ¬£35m bid.

The former Chelsea boss is believed to be frustrated by the lack of transfer activity and is keen to bring in several more signings before the window closes.

But The Foxes are adamant they don't want to sell and if Jose Mourinho wants to land his man then it's going to take an offer of ¬£80m to even tempt them. That seems highly unlikely given the sulking United boss's transfer stand-off with Ed Woodward, and so Maguire looks set to stay put and land a bumper pay rise in the process. Leicester are poised to offer the 25-year-old a ¬£95,000-a-week deal ‚Äì almost doubling his current wages ‚Äì which means Maguire stands to haul in an extra ¬£21.6m on the back of his Russian exploits and United's interest. Maguire, signed from Hull for what now looks a bargain ¬£17m just 12 months ago, would favour a move to Old Trafford but is not thought to be ready to push the issue. Foxes boss Claude Puel is desperate to avoid a repeat of the unsettling circus which surrounded Riyad Mahrez before he eventually got his ¬£65m move to Manchester City. Leicester's wealthy Thai owners refused to be bullied into a cut-price deal for Mahrez and are now prepared to dig in and show the same resolve. Maguire's new deal would make him Leicester's second highest earner, just behind England team-mate Jamie Vardy. The defender is on holiday in Barbados but is being kept informed of all developments. Leicester's refusal to budge is bad news for Mourinho, who is in virtual meltdown over the club's reluctance to release funds for new players. His mood has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks as executive vice-chairman Woodward shows no sign of reaching for the chequebook. Mourinho said he submitted five transfer targets a few months ago but moaned that with the August 9 transfer deadline day looming, he might only get one. That 'one' looks increasingly unlikely to be Maguire unless Mourinho can shift out a couple of surplus defenders and then persuade United's money men to move in with an offer that Leicester will struggle to refuse. Puel has made contingency plans for such an event with Newcastle skipper Jamaal Lascelles and Middlesbrough's Ben Gibson on his radar.",TRUE

Maguire followed that up with a series of excellent performances for England at the World Cup this summer. And now the commanding centre-back is on United's summer shortlist as Jose Mourinho looks to bolster his defensive options. Maguire has just under four years remaining on his current contract with Leicester, which means United would need to pay in the region of ¬£65m in order to sign the defender. And while Maguire has praised Leicester for their support, he admits he would welcome the chance to join United's fight for the Premier League title this season. 'Every player wants to play at the highest level,' Maguire told The Sun . 'I've just come back from playing at a World Cup, where I really enjoyed the high pressure of the games.

543,Leicester to counter huge bid from Manchester United by offering Harry Maguire new contract,"L eicester City are prepared to make Harry Maguire the second highest paid player at the club behind striker Jamie Vardy after warning Manchester United the England centre-half is not for sale. United are willing to smash the record fee for an English defender by offering in excess of ¬£60 million for Maguire as Jose Mourinho bids to bolster his back line. But Claude Puel wants to build his side around Maguire and Leicester are ready to demonstrate the 25-year-old's value to them with a new contract worth up to ¬£100,000 a week that would leave the player behind only Vardy in the club's pay stakes. Maguire would stand to earn more than that at Old Trafford but Leicester - who allowed Riyad Mahrez to join Manchester City for ¬£60 million earlier this month after rebuffing approaches for the Algeria playmaker in previous windows - insist there is no desire or imperative for them to sell. Maguire's financial position has been strengthened by his impressing showings for England at the World Cup in Russia this summer and United's interest only 12 months after the defender - who has four years left on his existing deal - joined Leicester from Hull City for ¬£17 million. U nited approached Leicester this week and will not be easily dissuaded but it could take an eye-watering offer of more than ¬£70 million - close to the world record ¬£75 million fee Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January - to force the Midlands club to soften their stance. As Leicester have proved with Mahrez in the past, though, they will not be bullied into selling. K yle Walker, who joined Manchester City from Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£50 million last summer, is currently the most expensive English defender in history. Toby Alderweireld, of Spurs, and AC Milan's Leonardo Bonucci are other centre-halves with whom United have been linked. With the transfer window due to close on August 9 - the day before United face Leicester at Old Trafford in the Premier League curtain raiser - time is running out for Mourinho to strengthen his defence. The United manager is also under pressure to offload one of his existing five centre-halves after being told the club cannot continue to stockpile defenders. One defender who is expected to leave Old Trafford before the window closes is Matteo Darmian. The Italy right back was given the captain's armband during United's friendly against AC Milan in Los Angeles in the early hours on Thursday but Darmian is still hoping to quit Old Trafford this summer as he does not feel he will play enough first team football next term. M ourinho has confirmed he will allow the Italian to leave in this transfer window but warned they have yet to receive a realistic offer and would not let him go cheaply. The manager praised Darmian's attitude ‚Äì which is why he made him captain against Milan ‚Äì but both men would prefer to part ways. N ow 28, Darmian - who joined United from Torino for ¬£12.7 million in 2015 - does not want to spend another season offering cover at right back, particularly following the ¬£19m arrival of Diogo Dalot which has seen him fall to third in the pecking order behind Antonio Valencia and the young Portuguese defender. Juventus, Napoli, Roma and Inter Milan have all been linked with Darmian over the past year. ""It was an honour for me to be captain and I'm very happy,"" said Darmian. ""It was probably because we played against my old team [Milan]. ""But yes, I still want to leave, that what I want. But we will see what happens because we don't know. ""I don't think the injury of Antonio Valencia is a big injury. I don't know how long he needs to stay out, but at the moment he is the captain, he's first choice. ""I want to play more regularly. Last season I didn't play much - that's my objective and my ambition. That's why I spoke with the manager and also with the club about my future. ""I'm waiting to see what happens. If I stay I stay and I'll do what I did up until now. If I go it is because the offer that another team makes will be good. ""It has been a difficult decision [to want to leave].

549,Domingos Quina: Why are Barcelona tracking West Ham's youth star?,"Barcelona are set to hold talks with West Ham over youngster Domingos Quina after sending one of their top recruitment chiefs to watch him help Portugal reach the final of the U19 European Championships. Sky Sports News understands representatives of the Spanish champions travelled to Finland to see Quina in action and now plan a potential deal to take him to the Nou Camp. The 18-year-old attacking midfielder has struggled for first-team opportunities at the London Stadium after switching from Chelsea in 2016, however, and the Hammers are prepared to let him go this summer with just a year remaining on his contract. So why are Barcelona - and several other top scouts around Europe - so excited about him? Why has he not managed to break through at West Ham? With the help of former head of talent identification at Tottenham and ex-Bournemouth head of recruitment, David Webb, Sky Sports takes a closer look... Quina was born in the former Portuguese colony of Guinea-Bissau in Africa but is the son of former Portugal international Samuel Quina, and both father and son came through the youth ranks at Benfica. Domingos joined Chelsea in 2013 and started to shine in youth football in England. But Webb, who had just joined Spurs as head of youth talent identification, said it was a game for Portugal's U17s in 2015 that put Quina on the scene. A year before his youth contract at the Blues would come to an end, he began to raise the eyebrows of Premier League talent spotters. ""I first saw him playing for Portugal against Italy in an U17 game when I was at Tottenham,"" Webb says. ""I didn't know much about him but Portugal beat Italy 6-0 and he scored a hat-trick. My first impression was: 'Wow, who's this?' ""He was technically very good, athletically very good, and very gifted in terms of his movement and awareness. He appeared to be a very clever player, especially for his age. As well as those attributes, he showed he could score goals and create too. ""Character-wise, he is quite an aggressive player as well when he plays. He seems to have a good work ethic and have that hunger to win the ball back for his team. And that's really how a player can get to the top - if he has that about him, as well as an ability to affect games. ""It was a good Italy team with some good players, but he stood out like a sore thumb. There were a lot of scouts there from UK clubs, as there always are with games like that - and he made an impact to say the least."" Although a case could have been made for him to stay at Stamford Bridge and be part of Chelsea's youth success, including at U19 level, it has frequently proved difficult to break into the first team from academy level with the Blues. So, as Quina's youth terms came to an end in the summer of 2016 and after his superb performances for Portugal U17s, he decided to choose a route via another club. A number of Premier League clubs - including Arsenal - are understood to be have been keen but so how did West Ham jump to the head of the queue? Slaven Bilic was the manager at the time and was keen to bring through some young players. The likes of Reece Oxford and Reece Burke were in and around the first team and the London Stadium appeared to have offered promise at the start of the 2015-16 season. Quina, as it happened, made just one start for the seniors and five more from the bench in cup competitions. Webb believes the Hammers would have had the best of intentions to help Quina progress, but in battling relegation over the last two seasons, were unable to blood academy prospects. ""He was about to be out of contract on youth terms at Chelsea, and had a situation where he could leave for minimal compensation, and I think he wanted to move somewhere in which he could get closer to the first team,"" Webb says. ""Chelsea have an exceptional youth loan system, giving young players opportunities to play at other top European clubs for valuable experience. This may have been another option for Domingos but it depends which pathway the player wishes to pursue. ""That was the thing with Quina - even at such a young age I think he felt in his mind he was good enough to play.

It was about his next progression really. ""I've more recently seen him in West Ham U23 games and he still stands out. He could be playing against established pros who are coming back from injury and players around the first team at their clubs in those games. He's definitely got the ability to step up.

They were battling relegation last season and that makes it more difficult to play young players.""

But Webb says it is no surprise the Barcelona have also taken notice and the transfer consultant believes Quina would fit into the Catalans' development model. ""With a year left on his contract, he's probably looking at it and thinking that he hasn't really had those opportunities in the first team at West Ham. With another new manager at West Ham and the investment they've made already, does he see himself being involved a lot? ""Maybe, maybe not, but being the exceptional player that he is, he'll be thinking where he can go to get that next step in his development phase. It would depend on what type of club he could go to to get that, but there are plenty around that give young players a chance. ""He could be a top young player and that next career move is vital for him, in terms of getting that first-team opportunity. He would fit at Barcelona because, technically, he is one of the best young players that I've seen in a while and he has the mentality to play for the team. ""Looking at England and possible suitors, you're looking at clubs who have a good recent history of bringing through young players, so clubs such as Tottenham are very good at that, Liverpool as well, and also historically clubs like Southampton, Arsenal and Man United.""",FALSE

Having been ready to hand Martial a final chance to impress him, boss Jose Mourinho has reluctantly now accepted his desire to leave United this summer after three years. Mourinho knows there is no value in keeping an unhappy player, although United will ensure Martial only leaves on their terms.

And he was shipped out on loan to Newcastle in January after scoring just once in 12 top-flight games last term. Slimani, 30, made only four appearances for the Magpies - and even landed a three-game ban for his red card against West Brom in May. The Algiers-born frontman is however still revered at Sporting. He scored 57 goals in four seasons for the Primeira Liga outfit, and helped them win the 2015 Portuguese Cup. Club president Jose de Sousa Cintra has declared his ambition to bring Slimani back to the Jose Alvalade Stadium, and officials have now put together a plan to re-sign the striker. Sporting want the north African star to replace Dutch striker Bas Dost, who hit 34 goals last season - but then cancelled his contract following months of off-field problems. The Lisbon club will ask Slimani to accept a pay cut to join them, admitting they cannot compete with his current salary. But they hope he will be tempted by the chance to return to centre stage with them after becoming a bit-part player in England. Sporting signed Slimani from home-country club CR Belouizdad in 2013. He went on to play 109 times for them. He is under contract with Claude Puel's side until 2021.",FALSE

An agreement is said to be finalised between Real and Courtois' representatives. However, both clubs are yet to agree on a transfer fee for the Belgium star, who is valued at around ¬£35m. Real are also looking at Tottenham's Hugo Lloris should their move for Blues No 1 Courtois fall through. However, Spurs will refuse any offers for the France international, who won the World Cup in Russia this summer. Courtois has one year remaining on his current Chelsea contract and talks over a new deal are at a standstill.

The shot-stopper is out of contract next summer and free to leave the club for nothing, with Chelsea set to cash in after he intimated that he would not be signing an extension. And now Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws report that Courtois' move back to the Spanish capital is nearing completion and he has already agreed a five-year contract. The 26-year-old will earn ¬£11.5million per season, a significant increase on his ¬£7.2m-a-year deal at Chelsea. He is currently holidaying in Tenerife and waiting for a phone call to say Chelsea have accepted Real Madrid's bid, which has already been agreed between the clubs at ¬£35m. Courtois is ready and waiting for the go-ahead to fly from Tenerife to Madrid to undergo a medical and sign his contract. But before sanctioning the sale, Chelsea want to sign a replacement for Courtois and are preparing a late move to hijack Liverpool's deal for Roma goalkeeper Alisson. Courtois could be joined by Chelsea teammate Eden Hazard in Madrid; Real are working on the two deals separately, but reports in Italy suggest a formal offer of ¬£107m has been lodged. Chelsea are holding out for a bigger fee and a fresh offer is expected to arrive in the next few hours, with both Hazard and Courtois keen to remain teammates.",TRUE
573,Real Madrid Reportedly Agree Terms with Chelsea Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois,"Real Madrid have reportedly finalised terms with Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after months of speculation, although the two clubs are yet to come to an agreement over a transfer fee. Simon Jones and Jonathan Spencer of MailOnline wrote that Real have taken a substantial step towards signing Courtois but they're keeping an eye on Tottenham Hotspur 's Hugo Lloris as an alternative. Los Blancos have long been rumoured as wanting to replace current No. 1 Keylor Navas, and one of Julen Lopetegui's most significant moves in his first summer in charge could be the acquisition of Courtois. Courtois has been reported as Real's primary choice to replace Navas after their pursuit of Manchester United 's David De Gea failed to bear fruit while forward Eden Hazard has also been linked with Los Merengues.

The difficulty for the London club is that Courtois now has less than a year remaining on his Chelsea contract, meaning this summer stands to be their last opportunity to clinch a significant fee. Courtois has just won the Golden Glove at the 2018 FIFA World Cup as Belgium finished third in Russia, while France No. 1 Lloris, 31, won the tournament after his side beat Croatia 4-2 in the final. Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso echoed Sarri's sentiment in that he felt Courtois would still be at Stamford Bridge come the beginning of the new season, via Sky Sports: Could Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois leave Stamford Bridge?

The 26-year-old spoke to radio show El Partidazo (h/t ESPN FC's Dermot Corrigan ) during the World Cup and highlighted his family as a particular factor in his transfer motives: ""The only thing I have always said is that after the World Cup I will look at everything. The most important thing for me is my children, and I will make the best decision for me in everything."" Real have already signed Ukrainian goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, 19, from Zorya Luhansk but the teenager isn't ready for first-team duties.

Reports have claimed the Blues are willing to let him go should they receive an offer that meets their demands. However, the Daily Mail say Chelsea have now changed their mind on selling Courtois in the wake of Real Madrid 's first failed bid. The La Liga giants submitted an offer of ¬£100million to the Blues for Courtois and his Chelsea team-mate Willian. The west London club, though, thought that offer was too low. Real Madrid were supposedly willing to spend ¬£35m to land Courtois, whose contract expires next summer. However, Chelsea are prepared to get tough by sticking to their guns and refusing to let him go. Courtois first flirted with a Real Madrid move in February, saying: ""My personal situation is related to the city of Madrid, it's known. ""My two children live there with their mum. I have my daughter every day on Facetime. ""She often tells me that I miss her. My son is still too small to communicate like that. ""Whenever I have the opportunity, I try to make a return trip to Spain. As a situation, it is not always easy. Yes, my heart is in Madrid. It is logical and understandable.""

It was a decision that has seemed vindicated with Courtois since proving himself worthy of wearing the No 1 jersey at Stamford Bridge. However, the 26-year-old may leave Chelsea this summer with a return to La Liga, where his family leave, his main priority. Courtois has already admitted as such, hinting at a desire to join Real Madrid by saying: ""My personal situation is related to Madrid ""My two children live their with their mother, I speak with my daughter each day on Facetime and she often says that she misses me. ""My son is still very young to be able to communicate that way, each time I get a chance I travel to Spain and this is a situation which is not always easy. Yes, my heart is in Madrid."" And Marca suggest Chelsea regret loaning Courtois out for so many years as it allowed him to lay down roots in Spain, meeting the mother of his two children, who still live in Madrid. As a result, the goalkeeper now wants to leave Stamford Bridge. Chelsea are aware of his decision to leave and appear to be eyeing replacements for their current No 1. Roma's Alisson Becker is understood to be on a list of targets devised by Roman Abramovich. The 25-year-old is set to start for Brazil when they face Mexico in the last 16 of the World Cup today. And Chelsea are keeping tabs on him amid interest from Real and Liverpool. Another player who could replace Courtois is AC Milan's Gianluigi Donnarumma.

William remains determined to quit Stamford Bridge this summer, whether new boss Maurizio Sarri likes it or not. The Brazilian midfielder fell out with former boss Antonio Conte last season and has been concerned with the negative tactics employed by the side.

The Belgian, who joined the Reds from Sunderland in 2013, is Barca's main target as they look to replace current No2 Jasper Cillessen. Mignolet, 30, split duties with Loris Karius in the Anfield nets last season but by the end of the campaign was the clear back-up behind his German rival. But with the Reds having brought in ¬£67million Roma keeper Alisson to replace the two error-prone stoppers, both Mignolet and Karius are being offered to other clubs. And Sky Sports report the La Liga champions are at the front of the queue for Mignolet, looking to wrap up a ¬£12.5m deal. Cillessen, 29, wants to leave the Nou Camp after growing frustrated at a bench role, having failed to displace Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The move could spark a ¬£100m summer firesale at Liverpool , who are looking to sell as many as eight players before the window deadline. Strikers Divock Origi and Danny Ings are linked with ¬£26m and ¬£20m moves respectively, while Lazar Markovic is expected to leave for a cut-price ¬£7m. Youngsters Ben Woodburn, Sheyi Ojo and Marko Grujic are most likely set for loan moves but could be let go permanently if the right offer comes in, while Pedro Chirivella is set to join Norwegian side Rosenborg in a ¬£3.5m deal.

579,"Liverpool transfer news: Reds facing Simon Mignolet decision, Barcelona interest quashed","The Reds' goalkeeping department has undergone major changes this summer with the addition of Alisson from Roma for a world-record fee for a keeper at ¬£66.8million. The Brazilian replaces Loris Karius as Liverpool's No 1 following the German's struggles since a traumatic Champions League final display in which his errors helped lead to a 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid. And another casualty of Alisson's arrival is Mignolet, who had already looked likely to leave having been made second fiddle to Karius since January. Liverpool has reportedly looked to earn around ¬£12million from the sale of the Belgian, who still went to the World Cup despite his lack of football beyond the festive period. But the Liverpool Echo say that the Merseyside outfit have yet to receive any offers anywhere near that amount for the out-of-favour 30-year-old. Given Mignolet's desires for more first-team football and certainly more than on offer at Anfield, where he would be only third choice before injuries, Liverpool may have to sanction a loan move. The shot-stopper is due back on Merseyside this Sunday to start his pre-season preparations having reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, where Belgium finished third after beating England in a third-placed play-off. Mignolet has been at Liverpool since joining from Sunderland for ¬£9m in 2013 and has since made exactly 200 first-team appearances, but his stint at the club is all but over despite his imminent return. Recent reports from Spain have indicated that La Liga giants Barcelona are interested in Mignolet with their current No 2 - Jasper Cillessen - widely expected to leave. Marc-Andre ter Stegen's undisputed role as first choice have left minutes sparse for Cillessen and in searching for a new back-up, Mignolet has apparently popped up on Barca's radar. But the Echo say that neither the player's representatives or the club have received any contact from the Catalan club over a potential deal. Turkish outfit Besiktas are known to be keen on a deal but would prefer a season-long loan having never paid more than ‚Ç¨8m (¬£7.1m) on a player despite signing Demba Ba, Ricardo Quaresma and Alvardo Negredo in recent years. Liverpool had hoped that Mignolet would raise similar funds to that of Danny Ward, who was sold to Leicester City for ¬£12.5m shortly after completing a deal for Alisson. Yet if they are to grant Mignolet his wish of more minutes, they must lower their fee or consider a loan. The goalkeeper has three years left to run on his contract with the club but his agent has been far from subtle when discussing his client's future. Nico Vaesen recently told Belgium's Walfoot: ""Our goal is to find a solution for Simon to play and Alisson's arrival doesn't change that.

After Real missed out on Roma's Alisson, who joined Liverpool in a ¬£67m deal, they have been forced to turn their attention elsewhere. David de Gea is a long term target for Los Blancos , but signed a new five-year deal at Manchester United in June. Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois was thought to be next on the list after he professed a desire to be reunited with his wife and children in the Spanish capital. But a move for the Belgian has not progressed and now Lloris is in Madrid's firing line, according to the Sun .

The total expenditure on the new White Hart Lane ground could reach ¬£1bn, and the Madrid offer could prove too good to turn down. Lloris is reportedly open to a move to the Champions League winners but is unlikely to force a move away, with his contract situation still putting a lot of power in Spurs' hands.

His reputation took a minor hit during the World Cup final when he gifted Croatia a consolation goal. But it is thought that his two stunning performances against Madrid in the Champions League group stage last season are enough to convince them of his quality.

Football Espana referred to recent reports suggesting Sporting were confident of securing a ‚Ç¨45 million (¬£40 million) fee for their player, who was linked with a series of major European clubs following the fallout in Lisbon. Spanish football writer Colin Millar related the signing to that of Rui Patricio, who was among the first to have his deal at Sporting terminated this summer before joining Wolverhampton Wanderers: Atletico Madrid sign Gelson Martins as a 'free agent' but Sporting CP may demand up to ‚Ç¨45m for deal. Similar to Wolves signing of Rui Patricio. Initially reported as a free transfer but likely eventual cost exceeding ‚Ç¨30m.

Along with signing striker Antoine Griezmann and defender Lucas Hernandez to new deals, the future looks bright at the Wanda Metropolitano, Yahoo's Andrew Gaffney suggested: Gelson Martins joins Atletico Madrid on a free (!) transfer. I still find it utterly bizarre these Sporting players are being allowed to leave for nothing. Atletico, on the other hand, are creating a fantastic squad. https://t.co/ePNgHexMb4 Diego Simeone is hoping to go one better than last season's runners-up finish in La Liga and this time go the whole hog by taking the title from Barcelona, and this summer's business suggests the intent to fight is there.

Martins netted 27 goals and recorded 30 assists in 140 appearances for Sporting, but the Euro 2016 winner faces a step up in moving to La Liga. ESPN FC's Dermot Corrigan acknowledged the winger has parts of his game that are in need of ironing out, although the capture is an exciting one for the club: Remains to be seen how Gelson Martins - who loves a trick but has plenty of rough edges from what I've seen - survives under Simeone. But on a free a 23 year old with 17 senior Portugal caps is pretty amazing business. Yannick Carrasco and Nicolas Gaitan left for Chinese club Dalian Yifang in February to lessen Atleti's wide options, while Vitolo failed to impress as some might have hoped during his first campaign in Madrid.

Boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to make Maguire his fourth summer signing after landing Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant. He has told United chiefs to complete a deal before the transfer window closes on August 9 - but Woodward's approach has been greeted with a luke warm response from the Foxes. The former Premier League champions have no intention of selling the England ace and still hope he will sign a new deal at the King Power Stadium. Leicester will only consider selling Maguire, 25, if he makes it clear to them that he wants to go to Old Trafford. Even then they will demand a fee of ¬£80m for someone who cost them just ¬£17m from Hull 12 months ago. The Foxes are loathed to lose another star player following Riyad Mahrez's ¬£60m move to Manchester City earlier this morning. The Midlands outfit are also under no financial pressure to sell Maguire - and know his value will continue to rocket in coming seasons. It remains to be seen if United are now willing to spend so much on a centre back when Mourinho already has Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Victor Lindelof and Marcos Rojo at his disposal. Starsport understands Woodward is becoming concerned by Mourinho's obsession with stock-piling defenders at Old Trafford - and wants him to sell at least one of them to help fund the arrival of Maguire. The pressure is also mounting on Woodward as he looks to provide Mourinho with a side capable of challenging for the title again. He drew a blank when it came to Real Madrid's Gareth Bale and has also been snubbed by Croatia and Inter Milan ace Ivan Perisic. Maguire knows his stock has never been higher following his stunning exploits at the World Cup with England.

It means United have made back-up plans with Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld an alternative option. Grayson added: ""Maguire has played a lot more in the last few years, he's slightly younger, but ultimately it'll come down to which one will be available.

591,Man Utd transfer news: Harry Maguire could become the world's most expensive defender EVER,"United face a serious battle to land Maguire and will have to shell out in the region of ¬£80m to get him. This would be more than the world-record ¬£75m Liverpool spent on luring Virgil Van Dijk from Southampton last season. United boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to make Maguire his fourth summer signing after landing Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant. And Maguire is open to a move to Old Trafford, where he would be guaranteed regular Champions League football and could also treble his wages. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has approached Leicester but the response was no more than lukewarm. The former Premier League champions have no intention of selling the England star and still hope he will sign a new deal at the King Power Stadium. They will only consider selling Maguire, 25, if he makes it clear to them that he wants to go to Old Trafford ‚Äì and they will demand a fee of ¬£80m for a player who cost them just ¬£17m from Hull 12 months ago.

The club are also under no financial pressure to sell ‚Äì and know Maguire's value will continue to rocket in coming seasons. It remains to be seen if United are now willing to spend so much on a centre-back when Mourinho already has Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Victor Lindelof and Marcos Rojo at his disposal. Woodward is becoming concerned by Mourinho's obsession with stock-piling defenders ‚Äì he is also interested in Colombia's Yerry Mina ‚Äì and wants him to sell at least one of them to help fund the arrival of Maguire.

592,Man Utd transfer news: Ed Woodward may defy Jose Mourinho orders to seal one transfer,"Manchester United chief Woodward is at loggerheads with Mourinho over the club's transfer business this summer. Mourinho, not content with Fred, Diago Dalot and Lee Grant, wants more. Watching Manchester City waltz to the easiest of Premier League title triumphs last season has convinced him of that. But so far, Woodward has refused to appease his Manchester United manager. Some have claimed the money has dried up, while others claim he simply wants Mourinho to sell before buying. The Daily Mail say that Mourinho wants the club to fork out for Leicester powerhouse Harry Maguire. Maguire's stock has never been higher. He signed for the Foxes from Hull for just ¬£17million a year ago and a stellar Premier League campaign, coupled with a fine World Cup, has seen his price tag soar. Leicester are aware of United's interest. Express Sport understands that, for all the claims of Maguire wanting to move, the defender and his representatives have so far made no comment on the transfer talk. As a result, they are happy to drive a hard bargain. It will take a fee of well over ¬£50million for Leicester to even remotely consider taking the negotiation table. However, the Daily Mail claim that, despite Mourinho wanting Maguire, Woodward may opt for Alderweireld instead. The Tottenham star remains the source of much discussion. Spurs know that, if they fail to offload him this summer, they face losing him on the cheap in 12 months time. And Woodward, fed up with Mourinho's public blasting of himself and the club, may choose to sign Alderweireld instead of Maguire. How that would go down with Mourinho remains to be seen. The United boss wants two signings but, speaking last night, described ending up with one as 'fine.' He said: ""I am confident I will get one, but I think two I am not going to get - which is not a drama. ""In every pre-season it happens the same, with every club, which is that the manager wants more. ""It's our nature, you always want more for your team, but then club decisions are different and normally you don't get what you want, which happened during all my career.

593,Man Utd transfer news: Jose Mourinho plans for Chelsea star Willian concern club hierarchy,"Manchester United boss Mourinho managed Willian at Chelsea and would love to bring the Brazilian to Old Trafford. The winger is on the Red Devils' radar as they frantically hunt reinforcements with just nine days of the transfer window remaining. Manchester United 's summer, so far, has disappointed. Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant are all they have to show for their efforts at a time where Liverpool and Manchester City, Champions League finalists and Premier League winners last season, continue to strengthen. And the Daily Telegraph say United bosses are concerned that Mourinho wants Willian in - and is prepared to give Martial to Chelsea - due to the long-term prospects of both players. The France international is determined to secure a move away despite Ed Woodward's plan to trigger a one-year extension clause in his contract. Chelsea are understood to have an interest in Martial and would relish the chance to land the 22-year-old. And the Telegraph suggest Mourinho is open to a sensational swap deal, in a transfer that would rock the Premier League. However, the United board are opposed to that idea due to the long-term logistics of any potential exchange. Both teams would benefit from a potential transfer. Chelsea would be signing a Martial who, despite enduring two difficult seasons under Mourinho, remains one of France football's biggest hopes. And United would secure a Willian whose experience and penetration would benefit their lopsided attack. Mourinho, meanwhile, feels he will only sign one more player this summer despite wanting a centre-back and winger. The United boss said: ""I am confident I will get one, but I think two I am not going to get - which is not a drama.

Jose Mourinho is ready to offer as much as ¬£50million for the England hero. According to the Daily Mail , Mourinho is ready to replace Chris Smalling of Phil Jones with Maguire, who has been one of England's heroes at the World Cup. Leicester City's Thai owners will fight to keep the centre-back for whom they paid only ¬£12m - rising to ¬£17m - last summer. Maguire, 25, moved to the King Power Stadium from Hull City last summer, playing in all 38 Premier League matches. He was one of the key men as Gareth Southgate's Three Lions reached the semi-finals of the World Cup. Maguire was arguably England's most consistent defender and was a constant threat from set-pieces. He scored in the quarter-final win against Sweden. Leicester are also believed to be considering offering the defender a new deal to try and keep him at the club.

""Maguire is due to return from holiday in the next few days and is understood to be keen to make the move to Old Trafford."" It's added that Leicester do not want to lose the defender, especially after selling key player Riyad Mahrez to Manchester City already this summer. Maguire only joined the Foxes a year ago from Hull City and enjoyed a fine campaign at the heart of the team's defence. The 25-year-old settled in immediately at the King Power Stadium and went on to win the club's Player of the Year prize. The reward for that excellent form was a call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and Maguire was excellent during the tournament , defending with diligence and providing composure on the ball at the base of the team. As ESPN's Alex Shaw noted, it's been a rapid rise to the top: Come on. Had you said after the FA Cup final, Man United would make ¬£60m Harry Maguire a top target, you'd have been laughed at. Don't be ridiculous and claim otherwise. If a transfer to United does go ahead, that rise will continue for Maguire, as he would surely be entrusted with being the key figure at the back for Jose Mourinho's team. Finding that defensive leader has been a massive issue for the United manager since Mourinho's arrival in 2016. He's spent big money on Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof in an attempt to add a mainstay in this area, while the likes of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo have all shown weaknesses when given chances in the side. Maguire would bring something different, as he's aggressive in the air and is tuned in to attacking movements. Crucially, he's better on the ball than any of the Red Devils' defensive options, as Maguire can stride forward in possession and play passes into midfield, as these figures illustrate: Most dribbles completed of defenders in the last two Premier League campaigns: ü•á Harry Maguire -- 80 ü•à Hector Bellerin -- 70 ü•â Antonio Valencia -- 66 https://t.co/u1L5IIE9DD The ¬£65 million fee is undoubtedly eye-catching, especially given Leicester only paid ¬£17 million to sign him from Hull last summer. The move would surely be appealing for the player, whose stock is high after his World Cup performances. With that in mind, the chance to make the switch to an enormous club like United may not come around again.

The France defensive midfielder, 29, has a ¬£30million release clause with the Spanish outfit. But new Gunners boss Unai Emery is aware that any further signings will have to be on the cheap after a busy window. The Gunners have picked up five players so far this summer, splashing out close to ¬£70m. Nzonzi, 29, was a regular during Emery's two seasons as Sevilla boss. He has been a long-time target for the Gunners, who want to bolster their defensive set-up before their opener against Manchester City on August 12. The midfielder is currently under contract until 2020, but has attracted a lot of attention of late. But Arsenal seems a more attractive prospect as there's the opportunity to be reunited with his former Sevilla boss. SunSport reported how during France's World Cup campaign he spoke openly about wanting to be playing for a bigger club . N'Zonzi has already had a taste of Premier League action, after signing with Stoke City in 2015, but wants to create a name for himself on the European stage. The Spanish news agency EFE reported that it wasn't N'Zonzi that made his intention known, but rather it was his father who informed Sevilla in writing that his son wants to leave.

605,Jose Mourinho aims dig at Anthony Martial after Manchester United's win against Real Madrid,"Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho took a thinly veiled swipe at Anthony Martial after the Red Devils' 2-1 win against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Mourinho's men rounded off a difficult tour of the United States with a victory against the La Liga giants thanks to goals from Alexis Sanchez and Ander Herrera. Martial left United's tour a week ago for the birth of his child with partner Melanie Da Cruz but has failed to return to United's tour and Mourinho admits he's unsure when the Frenchman will return to training. Mourinho finally did have some good news after the win against Madrid by confirming that Romelu Lukaku has cut short his holiday and took a swipe at Martial by praising the Belgian's commitment. 'My players [have been] amazing in their effort but we have more effort in front of us,' said Mourinho. 'We go to Munich in a few days and we start the Premier League in nine days. These are the players that we have plus Lindelof, that started training two days ago, plus Marcus Rashford, Jones and Lukaku, because they gave to the group and to the team three days of their holidays. 'So, they're coming back three days early to try and be available for the team [against Leicester on August 10). 'And with the fantastic spirit we have, in the majority of the players, I repeat: in the majority of the players, we have a fantastic spirit, we go with everything we have to the Premier League.' Mourinho was then asked explicitly about Martial's situation and whether the 23-year-old will return to training in Manchester when the Red Devils return.

606,Jose Mourinho will allow Anthony Martial to leave if Manchester United sign superstar replacement,"Although Manchester United 's hierarchy are reluctant to sell Anthony Martial, manager Jose Mourinho is prepared to let the winger leave, according to reports. Martial's agent dropped a bombshell on Wednesday night when he confirmed that the 22-year-old was disillusioned with life at Old Trafford and would look to leave the club this summer . Many at United are ready to block that request, but The Telegraph are reporting that Mourinho will give in to Martial's demands if he can land a high-quality replacement. Mourinho has lost faith in Martial despite a good first half of the season, with his game time significantly limited after the January arrival of Alexis Sanchez. And, if the Portuguese coach can land either Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale or Chelsea star Willian, he is happy to green light Martial's sale. However, both Mourinho and the club are reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, which could scupper their hopes of landing Willian if they will not permit Martial to go the other way. Tottenham are also interested, and Martial has intimated that he would be prepared to move to White Hart Lane, though United would rather he was sold abroad. Martial's agent, Philippe Lamboley, told RMC: 'They want to extend [Martial's contract] and do not want him to leave but we do not find agreement for several months.

607,Man Utd to resist any attempt from Spurs to sign Anthony Martial,"M anchester United are determined to resist any attempt by Tottenham Hotspur to sign Anthony Martial before the close of the summer transfer window, even though the striker is still tempted to leave Old Trafford. Martial has had a difficult relationship with United manager Jose Mourinho , spent much of last season out of the first team and looked miserable at the end of last season. He started just 18 games in the Premier League last season and infuriated his boss with a series of insipid displays when he was given a chance to re-establish himself in the team towards the end of the campaign. That had prompted speculation that he would be sold this summer, but the Red Devils do not want to lose him and are set to take up the option of extending his contract for another 12 months. As things stand, Martial only has one year left on his current deal, but United sensibly negotiated a clause that would allow them to add another year if they wanted to when they signed him back in 2015. T ottenham have been typically slow to get moving in the transfer market this summer , but with just three weeks remaining until the window closes, Martial is one of their long-standing targets and is thought to be keen on the move to London. Mauricio Pochettino believes he can revive the Frenchman's career in London and Tottenham are likely to test Mourinho's desire to hold on to a player he has had cause to chastise publicly in the past, particularly when his agent claimed he should leave Manchester because of the Portuguese. A bid of more than ¬£60m from Spurs would make things interesting, although Telegraph Sport understands the United hierarchy are not ready to give up on Martial and want to give him another season under Mourinho to see whether he can reignite his career. A lthough the 22-year old exploded on to the Premier League scene following a ¬£36m (which could rise to as much as ¬£57.6m if various performance related clauses are activated) move from Monaco three years ago, he has not progressed as hoped. Martial's poor form at club level and his failure to develop his game in England, meant he was also dropped from the France squad which won the World Cup in Russia earlier this month. Even though he is still in his formative years, Martial has been overtaken by younger rivals in France, not least Kylian Mbapp√©, who starred for his country at the World Cup and is three years younger. However, Ander Herrera believes he has seen a different Martial since the players returned to training earlier this month. ""He's very talented,"" said Herrera. ""He can be one of the best players in the world and I think he is very, very focused this season to smash it. ""When you have players like Anthony, like [Marcus] Rashford, Jesse [Lingard], Juan [Mata], Alexis [Sanchez], those kind of players that can change the game, if one of them cannot play, we have three or four more so we have lots of options. ""I think we shouldn't think that any other club in the Premier League has better players because at least we have as good as the opponents. ""Now it's all about work, confidence, about keep playing like he did today. I am confident with them because they are all amazing players and Anthony looks very sharp."" M eanwhile, another United youngster, Demetri Mitchell, has admitted he could be sent out on loan again this season despite starting in United's opening pre-season friendly against Club America last week. The 21-year-old, who has mainly played as a full back, was deployed as winger against the Mexican side in Phoenix, after returning from a successful loan spell in Scotland with Hearts. ""I'm just here to impress on tour and see what arises,"" said Mitchell. ""It's all up to the manager, whether he wants me to go out on loan or stay here this season. ""I'm just looking to impress as much as I can out here, whether it's left wing or left back and show what I can do. I've had a really good six months at Hearts.""",FALSE

609,Anthony Martial to Chelsea: Jose Mourinho could FORCE move worth ¬£60m ‚Äì expert,"The French striker found himself down the pecking order at Old Trafford last season with Jose Mourinho preferring the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Marcus Rashford. Following this summer's World Cup, the 22-year-old had to leave United's pre-season training camp in the US to attend the birth of his child. But the forward was slammed by his manager Jose Mourinho, who claimed he spent too long away from the training pitch. Rumours surfaced this morning that Martial could be on his way out of the Red Devils , in a swap deal for William , and football finance expert Kieran Maguire believes that is definitely a possibility. He told Star Sport exclusively: ""Chelsea are desperate for a centre-forward. ""With [Gonzalo] Higuain going to Milan on loan ‚Äì that knocked one of their ideas out and they might be willing to gamble on Martial. ""There is clearly a conflict with him and Mourinho. ""It started from him not getting a chance in the team last summer and heightened now over the snide comments over the birth of his son."" But the footie egghead detailed how the Manchester club may be more likely to favour a straight deal over a swap. He added: ""I think United will be looking to recoup the majority of the total they have committed to pay for him. ""So that will be around ¬£60m, for a reserve striker who has done reasonably well is a lot of money, but he is relatively young and he would like life in London."" Kieran is a chartered accountant with a background in finance but has channelled his skills to match his passions after gaining exposure from his explanation of the Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United in 2003. He now spends his time lecturing at Liverpool University, where he has become a specialist in football finance, and often appears on the BBC and Sky Sports. Earlier today, he revealed that Aaron Ramsey may be on his way to Old Trafford in a deal worth ¬£30m. And before that, he detailed how Unai Emery could land Ousmane Dembele at Arsenal.",FALSE
610,Everton Reportedly Prepare Jordan Pickford Contract to Ward off Chelsea Interest,"Everton have reportedly lined up an improved contract for Jordan Pickford in order to fend off Chelsea interest in the England goalkeeper. Chelsea are said to be considering Pickford as a replacement for Thibaut Courtois if he joins Real Madrid this summer. However, Paul Joyce of the Times wrote the Toffees will offer their No. 1 better terms ""to reflect his new standing"" at Goodison Park. The 24-year-old thrived in the starting role for England as they ran to the 2018 FIFA World Cup semi-finals in Russia, leading Chelsea to consider him as their heir to Courtois. The difficulty for Chelsea is that they have yet to resolve the future of Courtois, who is still on his post-2018 FIFA World Cup holidays after starring for Belgium in Russia. Courtois won the Golden Glove as he helped Belgium finish third at the tournament, and Sky Sports News reporter Rob Dorsett said only when he comes back will there be any movement: Understand #efc Jordan Pickford is #cfc first choice to replace Courtois at Stamford Bridge if, as expected, Courtois leaves for Madrid in this window. No formal approach as yet. Sarri has promised to talk to Courtois when he returns to training a week on Monday. The problem is that the Premier League transfer window closes on August 9, giving Chelsea little time to get a deal for Pickford done should Courtois leave‚Äînot to mention the fact Everton may be reluctant to sell with so little time to find a replacement of their own. Pickford isn't likely to come cheaply, either, considering the Toffees signed him from Sunderland last summer for ¬£30 million plus add-ons and he has four years left to run on that deal. The 24-year-old's profile was enhanced at the World Cup, where he allayed any fears that his height‚Äî6'1"" being relatively short compared to some top-class stoppers‚Äîwould be an issue for the Three Lions. In contrast, Courtois has been increasingly linked with Real after entering the final year of his Chelsea deal. The temptation may be to cash in this summer and take a higher fee, but author Mark Worrall judged the alternatives and said it would be preferable to lose the Belgian for nothing in 2019: Honestly, given the possibility of a goalkeeping trio of Reina, Caballero &amp; Green - I'd prefer it if Chelsea held Courtois to the last day of his contract &amp; made him play every first team game next season. Premier League points / places gained would offset transfer fee lost. Rob Green failed to make an appearance for Huddersfield Town last season but has been brought in by Chelsea this summer, although seemingly as little more than a method of fulfilling their homegrown player quota. Bleacher Report's Alex McGovern felt Pickford would be an acceptable replacement for Courtois given he too could count toward the homegrown quota and looked a good bet among the current market alternatives: Quite happy with Pickford as a Courtois replacement, given the available options. English + homegrown is a plus point too. It's unclear as to what terms Everton would be willing to offer their No. 1, but Chelsea could yet bank on their ability to trump any deal the Toffees could put in place. For that to materialise, however, the south-west London giants must decide Courtois' status at Stamford Bridge and whether they'll require a replacement at all this summer.",TRUE
611,Chelsea transfer news: Blues eye two goalkeepers after Jordan Pickford decision,"That's according to the Daily Star . They claim that Chelsea have given up hope of signing England star Pickford - who is likely to sign a new contract with Everton. The 24-year-old, who only signed for Everton from Sunderland for ¬£30million a year ago, was identified as their No 1 target in case Thibaut Courtois leaves. The Belgian is into the final year of his contract and is expected to leave for Real Madrid for around ¬£35m. But Chelsea will move on from Pickford, who starred at the World Cup with England over the summer, to target Paris Saint-Germain's Trapp and Atletico shot-stopper Oblak. Oblak was linked with Liverpool and Real Madrid earlier this summer and has a ‚Ç¨100million (¬£89m) release clause in his contract with Atleti. While he is rated as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe, Chelsea will likely be reluctant to meet that figure given it would once again smash the record fee for a keeper. The world record has already been broken in recent weeks by Liverpool's ¬£66.8m capture of Brazilian Alisson - who was thought to be on Chelsea's radar. Trapp would be a cheaper option having only made six Ligue 1 appearances for PSG last term with Alphonse Areola preferred in goal. Gianluigi Buffon's arrival further complicates matters for Trapp, who could be keen for a move away from Parc des Princes for increased game-time. The German still made his country's World Cup squad despite his limited minutes throughout the campaign, beating new Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno to the spot. It is not suggested how much PSG would want for Trapp, though the CIES Football Observatory recently valued the player at around ¬£12.7m.",FALSE

Courtois' two children live in Madrid and he is keen to join the La Liga giants after spending three years in the Spanish capital with Atletico. Chelsea have reportedly made Pickford their top target if Courtois does leave but Everton will be reluctant to sell a player who starred for England in this summer's World Cup. And Pickford also seems unconcerned by the links to Chelsea, saying his focus is on firing Everton into the top six this season. 'It is a quick turnaround but I am still fresh and raring to go,' Pickford said. 'I couldn't go straight back into it so I had a little break and I will go back in on Friday and get cracking and see how I feel ‚Äì maybe see if the gaffer will let me have a bit of game-time on Saturday. 'I just love playing football. I'm a football lad. I will go in on Friday and the first thing I will do is ask for some game-time on Saturday, hopefully to get the chance to play against Wolves the following week. 'I know myself that I will be more than ready so I can't wait.' Sam Allardyce has been replaced by Marco Silva at Goodison Park and the former Watford boss has enjoyed a productive transfer window, signing Richarlison and Lucas Digne for a combined ¬£58million. Pickford, who was named Everton's Player of the Season last year, is confident the new additions can help the Toffees improve during the 2018-19 campaign. 'I think it is a massive club and the club is only going in the right direction,' the star goalkeeper added. 'We want to do better. We finished eighth last season and so we want to get better than seventh, get into the top six. 'The Premier League is a hard league and it is hard to get a win in any game, but we want to please the fans and make the fans happy and the way to do that is win games.'",TRUE

Everton are desperate to hang on to their stopper as new boss Marco Silva looks to have a strong start and attempt to break into the top six. The Toffees have strengthened well by bringing in Richarlison from Watford but with the transfer window closing next week, Carragher is concerned about their defence. He said: ""They are one of the top clubs in the country, they should always be challenging for European places and they look miles away at the moment. ""It's worrying, really worrying.

614,Chelsea transfer news: Everton to offer Jordan Pickford new contract to end Blues interest,"The England No.1 is due to return to the club next week after an extended holiday, and the Toffees are desperate to tie down their Player of the Year for the long-term future. Chelsea stopper Thibaut Courtois has been heavily rumoured to be moving to Real Madrid, and Chelsea have been assessing a number of options to replace the Belgian. Along with the Everton stopper, Chelsea have been linked with his England team mate Jack Butland and Leicester's Kasper Schmeichel, as well as signing Rob Green as a third choice option. However, it is thought that Pickford sits at the top of their list and they are ready to pay big money to secure his signature. Pickford has only been at Goodison Park for a season since joining for ¬£30m from Sunderland and as such still has four years left to run on his current deal. Everton chiefs are taking no risks though, wanting to reward the 24-year-old for his inspiring form with an improved contract and lock him down for his best years.

Chelsea are understood to have made Pickford their first-choice target if Thibaut Courtois leaves this summer. The Belgian is into the final 12 months of his contract at Stamford Bridge and has been heavily linked with Real Madrid. And should they lose him, the Blues have identified Pickford - who enjoyed an excellent World Cup for England following a solid first season for Everton - as their new No 1. But Sky Sports say that Everton are keen to offer the 24-year-old a new contract to commit him to the club. The Toffees finished eighth, five points off Europa League qualification, last season but are under new management in Marco Silva this season. And they will hope that the former Sunderland keeper, who cost them ¬£30million a year ago, will turn down interest to stay at Goodison Park. Pickford was named the club's Player of the Year last season and losing him would be a huge blow to the Merseyside outfit. But Sky suggest that it is 'extremely unlikely' that Pickford will leave Everton this summer in spite of Chelsea's interest. It has been claimed by Sky Sports reporter Kaveh Solhekol that Chelsea would have to spend a world-record fee to land Pickford. He said: ""Chelsea do want to sign Jordan Pickford. He is their No.1 target if they do sell Thibaut Courtois. ""But you've got to be honest and say it's going to be very, very difficult to sign Jordan Pickford from Everton.

However, the Spaniard is determined to sign at least two more players but may have to offload the likes of Danny Welbeck and Nacho Monreal in order to raise funds for new arrivals.",FALSE

Spanish radio station Onda Cero claimed on Thursday that Barcelona are ready to test Chelsea's resolve by offering Dembele in their deal to sign Hazard . Football London journalist Charlie Watts claims that Emery sees Dembele as his 'dream signing', but that a loan is the only possibility. ""Demebele on his own would cost far more than whatever money comes in from those potential sales,"" Watts revealed. ""Mislintat would love Dembele, that would be his dream signing and he would slot in perfectly as well. ""But unless Barca decide to send him out on loan, it's not going to happen.""",FALSE
630,"Arsenal transfer news LIVE: DONE DEAL, Ousmane Dembele talks, agent invites Barcelona bid","Arsenal news LIVE updates: All the latest from the Emirates Saturday, August 4 Arsenal have kicked off their summer clear out by accepting a lowball bid for Lucas Perez. Sporting Lisbon are trying to sign the Spanish forward but were struggling to come up with the funds. Perez joined Arsenal for ¬£17m in 2016 and has scored just one goal. He went out on loan to Deportivo La Coruna last term and looks set for a permanent switch. Lisbon have offered just ¬£4.4m and Arsenal, according to Portuguese publication A Bola, have now accepted the offer in a bid to clear the decks. Arsenal are desperate to sell fringe players who are not in Unai Emery's plans. Arsenal want Ousmane Dembele - and Barcelona reportedly think they could generate enough money to kick their rebuild into gear by selling him. Mundo Deportivo say they are open to doing business as they believe they can fetch a huge fee for the teenager. However, Arsenal also need to sell before buying and time is running out with the transfer window closes for English teams to buy players on Thursday. So where Dembele ends up remains to be seen. Alex Iwobi has penned a new deal at Arsenal. Iwobi is hoping to have a big impact under Unai Emery. ""I'm very pleased Alex has signed a new contract with us,"" Emery said. ""He is a great example of a player who can succeed from the Academy through hard work and I look forward to working with him and our other talented young players in the squad."" Arsenal signing Ousmane Dembele could see Barcelona raid Manchester United for Paul Pogba, reports claim. Arsenal want Barcelona forward Dembele to be their sixth signing of the summer, after previously snapping up Stephan Lichtsteiner, Bernd Leno, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi. The France international may leave the Nou Camp in the wake of the Catalan giants' decision to sign Malcom from Bordeaux. And RAC1 claim that, if Arsenal secure his signature, Manchester United could pay the price. Sead Kolasinac has been ruled out for 10 weeks - meaning Unai Emery may be forced to sign a new left-back. The Bosnia international limped out of the Gunners pre-season friendly with Chelsea and is set for a long lay-off. Kolasinac had a difficult first season at the Emirates after arriving on a free. But Nacho Montreal will be the unrivalled left-back at the start of the Emery era unless he signs someone else. Arsenal have set their sights on a deal for Domagoj Vida before deadline day, reports claim. Arsenal have already made five signings under Unai Emery this summer. Although they have brough in a defender in the shape of Stephan Lichtsteiner from Juventus, but Emery still may look to strengthen his back four. As far as Vida is concerned, Liverpool have been keeping tabs on the Croatia international, who helped his country reach the World Cup final this summer where they lost against France. The 29-year-old only joined Besiktas in January and the Reds had a ¬£13.5million bid rejected. But now according to The Sun, the Gunners are ready to make their move. The report suggests a ¬£25m move has been approved by the board, however there is one condition for which the move could happen - either Danny Welbeck or Shkodran Mustafi. Friday, August 3 Arsenal have sold forward Chuba Akpom to PAOK. Arsenal academy product Akpom made his Gunners debut in 2013 after initially joining the club as a kid in 2002. But he failed to make it in the Arsenal first team and was sent out on loan six times. Now, the 22-year-old has finally secured a permanent move away from north London. ""We wish Chuba the best of luck with PAOK,"" the club wrote. Lucas Torreira has revealed why he's taken the No 11 shirt at Arsenal. The Uruguay international joined the north Londoners last month from Serie A side Sampdoria for a fee of ¬£26m. Upon announcing his signing, it was revealed that the 23-year-old had been assigned the No 11 shirt. The decision perplexed many Gunners fans, who were quick to point out the fact that defensive midfielders aren't traditionally given numbers historically reserved for creative players. Torreira explained his decision in a recent interview with Sport890 and revealed that it was partly motivated by his eagerness to sit next to his new midfield partner Mesut Ozil in the changing room. ""I wanted to choose the 34,"" the Uruguayan said. ""But it was already taken by Granit Xhaka, so I chose 11 because it is my birthday and I will have the opportunity to sit next to Mesut Ozil in the locker room. ""My place is next to Mesut. It's amazing, a player who was world champion and had a great career."" Sead Kolasinac has been ruled out for at least EIGHT weeks after picking up a knee injury against Chelsea on Wednesday. Kolasinac hobbled off in the second half and manager Unai Emery was unsure about his condition but Arsenal have announced the left-back will be out for at least two months. Aaron Ramsey was due to start against Chelsea but was pulled out after feeling his calf in the warm-up. And Arsenal have confirmed he ""developed tightness in his right calf"" but the Wales star will be assessed and is aiming to resume training next week. Both players will miss Saturday's pre-season friendly against Lazio. Former Premier League striker Dimitar Berbatov has delivered his Premier League predictions for the 2018/2019 season. The Betfair ambassador has backed Manchester United and Manchester City for a straight shoot-out to lift the trophy, with Tottenham sneaking second ahead of Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. ""There are so many talented teams, with great quality players, and it's hard for me to say one of them will definitely win,"" Berbatov told Betfair. ""It needs to be the team with the most quality, like Manchester City last season, they were fully equipped and deserved to be the Premier League Champions. ""This year I hope Manchester United win the Premier League, because obviously I used to play for them, but they have a good team and hopefully they can improve on last years' second place finish. I am also supporting Tottenham, not only because of my history there, however it's about time they win something!"" Arsenal could use Aaron Ramsey in a swap deal to land Steven Nzonzi, football finance expert Kieran Maguire claims. The Sevilla midfielder has been tipped to head to the Emirates this summer, with Unai Emery keen on the France international. Ramsey, on the other hand, has one year remaining on his current Arsenal contract. The Wales international is wanted by Chelsea, with new boss Maurizio Sarri keen to splash the cash. And Maguire says the Gunners could use Ramsey in a swap deal to secure Nzonzi before the transfer window shuts on August 9. ""In terms of Nzonzi, you are looking at around the same price level,"" Maguire told the Daily Star. ""He has a release clause of ¬£35m and Ramsey is in that ballpark, so it could work for both teams. ""In terms of wages, it would also work very well for Financial Fair Play, as Ramsey's wages are roughly ¬£10,000 less."" Everton have signed goalkeeper Joao Virginia from Arsenal for an undisclosed fee. Virginia has spent three years at Arsenal, featuring for the under-18s and under-23s. But the 18-year-old didn't make an appearance for the first team and has now decided to join Everton, managed by Portuguese coach Marco Silva. ""I am really happy to be at Everton,"" said Virginia. ""I hope to learn a lot from the goalkeepers here, Jordan Pickford, who had a great season and World Cup and Maarten Stekelenburg, who is very experienced, too. ""This is a great opportunity for me."" Arsenal are set to sign Romanian youngster Catalin Carjan. The Gunners have already signed five players in this transfer window. Matteo Guendouzi, Bernd Leno, Stephan Lichtsteiner, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Lucas Torreira have joined Arsenal ahead of the new season. And Unai Emery is also set to bolster his academy ranks by signing 15-year-old Carjan. The Viitorul Domnesti midfielder has revealed he will sign a contract with the Gunners when he turns 16 in December. ""It's something else,"" Carjan told Romanian outlet Digi Sport. ""It's a big difference I cannot wait to go there to sign and it's going to be much better. Ousmane Dembele's representatives are encouraging Arsenal to intensify their efforts to sign the Barcelona star, reports claim. The Gunners have frequently been linked with the French international, who is reported to be unsettled by Malcom's Nou Camp arrival. And Arsenal could pick up the pieces. Spanish radio station Cadena SER are claiming that Dembele's agents have been in touch. They report that Dembele, 21, is happy to stick with Barcelona but would happily listen to any offers that arrive before the transfer window closes next week. In addition to Cadena SER's claims, Football London say Arsenal transfer chief Sven Mislintat has been in touch. The 45-year-old knows all about the France international having brokered his move to Borussia Dortmund from Rennes in 2016. Whether it is enough for lure him to Arsenal, though, remains to be seen. Arsenal need a miracle to win the Premier League next season and Unai Emery must live up to the expectations at the Emirates, says Kanu. Arsenal haven't won the league since 2004 and finished a distant sixth in the table last season. And while Kanu, a two-time Premier League winner, feels Emery needs time, he also believes Arsenal must win silverware in 2018/19. ""We have to give him time for him to bring his own style and the way he wants to play,"" the 42-year-old told Press Association Sport. ""It takes time for the newcomers, the new signings, to adapt, but if it happens and they win the league it's a miracle ‚Äì I wish that would happen. The only thing the fans want is for them to win the league. ""First, second or third is successful. It's a very big club ‚Äì coming into a big club you need a trophy, so if you don't win the league, you need to win the others."" Sol Campbell cannot understand why the club have not yet managed to extend the contract of Aaron Ramsey. Ramsey's current deal at Arsenal expires at the end of the upcoming season with Chelsea and Barcelona both credited with interest. The Welshman confirmed talks are continuing with the club and his agent but an agreement is yet to be found. But Campbell has demanded Arsenal get their business in order and get the 27-year-old tied down. ""I don't know why it's taken such a long time to sign him,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""I just don't want the situation dragging on too far because that puts doubt in his head and then people start whispering and maybe people starting offering him another deal somewhere else."" Unai Emery has dropped a hint that may suggest Steven Nzonzi will not join Arsenal. Nzonzi has been linked with a move to the Gunners as Emery seeks to add more steel to his midfield. But Emery, speaking after the Gunners' penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea in the International Champions Cup, has appeared to rule out a move for Nzonzi. ""At the moment I am very happy with the players who are with here with us,"" Emery said. ""I am telling you, and we are saying internally, we are OK. And only want positives when we take the option to sign but not especially for Nzonzi."" Lucas Torreira will make his debut on Saturday against Lazio, Gunners boss Unai Emery has revealed. Torreira joined the north London outfit from Sampdoria last month for a fee believed to be in the region of ¬£26million. ""At the moment I am very happy with the players who are with here with us,"" Emery said last night when asked if there could be any more new arrivals. ""There are more coming; Nacho Monreal, Lucas [Torreira] and [Granit] Xhaka will start to play some minutes on Saturday."" Alexandre Lacazette insists there is no rivalry between him and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as they aim to be Arsenal's lead striker. Last night, Aubameyang started up front against Chelsea and was replaced by Lacazette in the second half with the Gunners trailing 1-0. But with virtually the last kick of the game, Lacazette equalised to take the game into a penalty shoot-out. With Arsenal's first Premier League game against Manchester City 10 days away, Emery will need to decide which system will get the best from Lacazette and Aubameyang. But Lacazette says there is no problem between him and Aubameyang and talked up their friendship. ""We know that if we are together, we can stronger and we just have the same target together, which is to win something for the club,"" Lacazette told Arsenal Player. ""So of course we don't have any problem with each other."" Watford have tied midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure down to a new five-year deal. The 25-year-old has been subject to intense speculation regarding his future this summer with Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton linked. Doucoure has developed into one of the best midfielders in the Premier League with his pace and power and attracted interest from some of the best clubs in the division. However, the Hornets have been able to persuade the Frenchman to commit his long-term future to the club. ""I am delighted that Abdoulaye has shown his commitment to what we are trying to achieve by signing a new long-term contract with Watford Football Club,"" chairman and chief executive Scott Duxbury told the club's official website. Arsenal will soon wave goodbye to Chuba Akpom and David Ospina - according to the bookies. Arsenal are reportedly willing to listen to offers for Danny Welbeck, Lucas Perez, Petr Cech, Carl Jenkinson, Shkodran Mustafi and Nacho Monreal. But it seems the next two men to follow the likes of Jack Wilshere in quitting the Emirates this summer might be Akpom and Ospina. Ladbrokes have suspended betting on markets regarding the duo leaving Arsenal, and although that doesn't mean it's certain they're off, it can be a strong indicator. Greek outlet Sport24 claimed earlier this week that Arsenal had agreed an ¬£890,000 (‚Ç¨1m) deal for Akpom with PAOK. Ospina, meanwhile, has been shunted down the goalkeeping pecking order by Bernd Leno's arrival in north London. The Colombian has struggled to establish himself during his four-year stint with Arsenal. Turkish newspaper Milliyet claim a deal for Ospina to join Besiktas will be completed next week. Laurent Koscielny admits he's thinking about leaving Arsenal and will not sign a new deal at the club. Koscielny is under contract at Arsenal for another two seasons but believes this will be his last deal in north London. The defender is out injured until next year so will miss the start to life under Unai Emery. Arsenal have signed Sokratis Papastathopoulos and have handed Calum Chambers a new contract. Emery remains in the hunt for new players and Koscielny has now admitted he's already thinking about his next move. ""I'm under contract until June 2020. Afterwards? I'm thinking of moving on, but I do not know where,"" he told Nice-Matin. ""This is not relevant anyway! I am in England, my family too. Then there will inevitably be a lot of question marks. The bottom line is to have health. I learned to relativise because there are so many more serious things in life.""",FALSE
631,West Ham in talks over ¬£22m signing of Porto striker Moussa Marega,"WEST HAM are in talks to sign ¬£22million-rated Porto striker Moussa Marega, according to reports. The deal, which could fall in price if Hammers midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate heads the other way , would take the club's summer spending past ¬£100m. Malian forward Marega, 27, struck 23 times as Porto won the Primeira Liga title last season, their first championship in five years. The Mail report talks have taken place between the two teams' representatives over a ¬£22m switch. But Porto could cut their asking price if Kouyate is included in any deal. West Ham 's transfer expenditure this summer currently sits at ¬£94m, with new boss Manuel Pellegrini having already brought seven new faces with him to the London Stadium. A club-record ¬£41m deal for Lazio's Felipe Anderson added to the ¬£22m spent on Issa Diop and ¬£17.5m paid to Borussia Dortmund for Andriy Yarmolenko . Lukasz Fabianski joined for ¬£7m from Swansea City while West Ham also paid ¬£3.5m for Fabian Balbuena . Free agent signings Jack Wilshere and Ryan Fredericks , moving across London from Arsenal and Fulham respectively, were the only arrivals not to dent the club's transfer budget. The Hammers' spree ranks second in the Premier League this summer, with only Liverpool 's ¬£175m outlay surpassing them. Pellegrini has shown no signs of ending his transformation of the squad, saying: ""We are trying to build a strong squad. ""We all know that the Premier League is not easy so we don't just need to have a good team, we need to have a good squad. ""For the moment we have seven new players and we also have three important players injured that we don't know when they can return - (Manuel) Lanzini, (Andy) Carroll and (Declan) Rice. ""Until the last day that we have time to bring players (in), we will try to build a strong squad."" Senegal captain Kouyate, 28, has been linked with a move away all summer, with Crystal Palace and Wolves reportedly interested. The defensive midfielder has been a mainstay in the Hammers side since joining from Anderlecht in 2014, racking up 147 appearances in four years and scoring 15 times. He played in all three of Senegal's World Cup games as they were cruelly knocked out at the first hurdle. The Lions of Teranga sat equal with Group H rivals Japan on four points but exited the tournament under the fair play rules, by virtue of picking up more yellow cards.",FALSE
632,Liverpool transfer news: West Brom keen on ¬£15m winger Sheyi Ojo,"The Reds wide-man faces an uncertain future at Anfield and the Liverpool Echo suggest that Ojo would be allowed to leave on a permanent deal this summer if the club's ¬£15million valuation was met. If not, the 21-year-old is likely to be loaned out - although his chances of a long-term future at the club look bleak despite his potential. The Baggies are looking for an immediate return to the Premier League after being relegated to the Championship back in May and the Echo say that they have established interest in signing Ojo. West Brom lost James McClean to Stoke City earlier this week while Nacer Chadli has had offers to leave the Hawthorns, offering regular minutes for Ojo out wide. Championship outfit Nottingham Forest have also been strongly linked with a host of other second division clubs, including Middlesbrough and Reading, said to be monitoring the forward's situation. That's after Ojo scored four goals and laid on two assists in 22 league appearances for Fulham - who earned promotion by winning the play-off final - last season. Ojo made his first-team debut for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp in January 2016 but has made just 13 senior appearances in total for the Merseyside club since then. The youngster has looked lively in Liverpool's pre-season so far, scoring in a win at Tranmere Rovers earlier this month, but opportunities are limited with Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and summer signing Xherdan Shaqiri ahead of him in wide positions. Ojo cost Liverpool ¬£2million when he signed from MK Dons at the age of 14 and has previously enjoyed temporary spells with Wigan and Wolves before Fulham. Speaking about his future, the Liverpool academy graduate told the club's official website earlier this week: ""I am just trying to focus on the present by training well, staying fit and healthy and trying to do the best I can in these [friendly] games I'm given. ""We've got to just see what happens after it. I feel like there comes a time when in order to make the next step, maybe you have to go out on loan and get a different experience. If that happens for me, then I'll be looking to keep improving and come back stronger. ""There are loads of different examples, but Mo [Salah] is probably the best example. When he was at Chelsea, he went out on loan and now look at him. He's done really well and is a star for our team. I'll be looking follow in those sort of footsteps and take it as it comes.""",FALSE

Speaking after Friday night's 1-1 friendly at Torquay, the Cardiff manager was asked about re-signing the Serbian international. Warnock told Sky Sports News : ""I'm always optimistic. You've got to be at my age. ""We were a bit thin on the ground (in midfield) against Torquay in that area without Aaron Gunnarson as well so it shows we've got to make sure we get somebody in, in that position."" Warnock has already made four signings this summer with the arrivals of Bobby Reid, Greg Cunningham, Josh Murphy and Alex Smithies. When asked if he is close to bringing in any other new players, he said: ""No not really. ""A couple of new names have been mentioned.

Barca signed him at the start of the year from Palmeiras but may now sell because he has been replaced by French star Clement Lenglet. United have made checks on Mina's availability and interest plus calls to Barca insiders to establish the cost of the whole package. Barcelona were looking for ¬£50m when initial interest started, with Everton and even Wolves also interested. But Mina, who cost ¬£10.5m in January, will plead for the Catalan giants to take less and let him have his dream move to Old Trafford. He would prefer a full-time deal despite Barca recently saying they would prefer to loan him. Mina struggled to get game time at the Nou Camp and made a couple of faltering displays that led to the Lenglet buy. Despite failing to impress at the Spanish champions, Mina showed his potential at the World Cup and scored a dramatic late equaliser against England in the round of 16.",FALSE
637,Yerry Mina wanted by Wolves as they eye shock loan bid for Barcelona World Cup sensation,"WOLVES are plotting a bold move for Barcelona's World Cup sensation Yerry Mina. And the Premier League new boys hope super-agent Jorge Mendes can help land the Colombia centre-back. Mina was one of the stars in Russia but his Barca future is uncertain, despite only joining in January. Wolves are keen on a season-long loan and could promise him the first-team football he craves. 'Mr Fixit' Mendes, who advises Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santos , is trying to strike a deal. Mina would prefer a bigger club but Wolves have shown they mean business. Everton and Spurs are also interested in the 23-year-old, whose 15 caps peaked with a spot of World Cup history this summer. Mina's stoppage-time equaliser against England in the last 16 made him the first ever defender to net in each of his first three games in football's greatest tournament. His climb and scoring header left Gareth Southgate 's eventual semi-finalists only squeezing through in a shootout. And it showcased the athleticism Mina showed alongside Tottenham's Davinson Sanchez at the heart of the Colombia defence. That dramatic moment brought him to the attention of the world.

638,Barcelona begin talks over a deal for Valencia's Dani Parejo,"Barcelona are studying the possibility of signing Dani Parejo. His name has appeared in recent meetings between the sporting department and the reality is the feeling is mixed on the midfielder. Ernesto Valverde, however is a huge fan of the player. Valverde believes Parejo is a good on the ball, has great vision, is adapted to LaLiga and the player would be happy to sign for Barcelona. At the moment the club has spoken to his entourage to see how viable a deal would be. The current plan for the sporting department is to not commit the same errors as previous years. It's important that they sign players who are good enough to fight for a starting place. Parejo fits due to his quality but everything depends on his price. One area the club agrees on is that ‚Ç¨50m would be far too much and any fee would need to be more realistic. Parejo's wages wouldn't be a problem but the only way a move happens is if the asking price is acceptable. The footballer would be willing to push for a move should Bar√ßa make a bid for his services. In Barcelona's favour is that Valencia are interested in many of their squad players, in particular Andre Gomes. Los Che are desperate to bring the Portuguese international back to the club and have told the player to hold off on a transfer away from the Camp Nou so he can join Valencia on loan. The only way Barcelona will allow this to happen is if they sign Parejo and are able to use Gomes to lower the asking price. If a deal isn't made for Parejo then Bar√ßa will sell Gomes to the highest bidder or, at worst, loan him to a club which is willing to cover the midfielder's wages - something Valencia can't afford to do. Bar√ßa have more or less finalised their squad, in terms of incomings, but Valverde would still like a ball-playing midfielder to round off his options. The deals for two main options - De Jong and Rabiot - aren't advancing as expected and it isn't inconceivable that both remain at their respective clubs this summer. This is why Parejo is a genuine alternative. Plus he has a relatively low asking price, will be easy to agree terms with and because he's someone Valverde likes. Despite that, Bar√ßa are going to wait another week and see if the other deals take a step forward. Valencia are aware of Barcelona's interest in Parejo and their coach, Marcelino Garcia Toral, has left the door open for the midfielder to leave. Parejo is valued by Valencia but his age and the fact his contract is up in 2020 means they can't discount a sale either. Key in all of this is the player's desire to move to the Camp Nou. He wants to sign for Bar√ßa and is waiting for them to firm up their interest with an official offer to Valencia.",FALSE
639,Barcelona transfer news: Ernesto Valverde considers swap deal with La Liga rivals,"The Catalans stormed to La Liga glory last term - but Ernesto Valverde is still looking to bolster his ranks. According to Spanish daily Sport , Parejo has been identified as a potential new arrival. Valverde wants more bodies in the middle of the park and Parejo is a hugely experienced campaigner. The 29-year-old central midfielder has racked up 207 La Liga appearances for Los Che since joining the club in 2011. Valencia value their influential star at a hefty ¬£44m. Barca, however, have baulked at his asking price and are hoping to snare him for far less. One major trump card for Valverde could be Valencia's interest in Andre Gomes. The 24-year-old has been a peripheral figure at the Nou Camp since signing from Valencia in 2016. He's made just 44 La Liga appearances during his two-year stay in Catalonia. Although his stock has fallen considerably, Marcelino could offer him the chance to rebuild his career at the Mestalla. Barca had been keen to sign PSG contract rebel Adrien Rabiot. The midfielder - who wasn't selected for Didier Deschamps' World Cup squad - wants pay parity with Marco Verratti and more guaranteed game time. The Italian playmaker currently earns around ¬£133,000-per-week and Rabiot is keen to get the same. His current deal expires in 2019 but the two parties remain in a stalemate.

Courtois is reportedly valued at ¬£32m by Chelsea because he has one year left on his contract and it is understood that he would not have any issues agreeing personal terms at the Santiago Bernabeu. Chelsea have signed former England goalkeeper Rob Green on a one-year deal this summer but the 38-year-old is likely to be third in the pecking order regardless of the situation surrounding Chelsea's first choice. The report adds that a deal for winger Willian, who was also the subject of a bid from Real Madrid, is not implicated in the Courtois negotiations and would not affect the possibility of that transfer going through. Real Madrid reportedly made a ¬£100m bid for the duo with Chelsea considering cashing in.",TRUE

Belgium international Courtois has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid and Chelsea have been drawing up a list of potential replacements which includes Pickford. Pickford enhanced his reputation as one of the best young goalkeepers around during the World Cup with England as he helped the Three Lions reach the semifinals in Russia.

""So you never know there could be something in there as well where they insert something outlandish but maybe something that would be affordable and benefit Everton in the long-term."" ""He's currently on an extended holiday is Pickford but it should also be remembered that Everton would be in the same situation as Chelsea are if they were to let Pickford leave. ""Because they'd only have two or three days if they were to get this deal over the line, Chelsea, to get in a replacement themselves.

649,Man Utd transfer news: ¬£35m Barcelona bid planned as Mourinho hopes to help 'dream move',"Manchester United remain on the hunt for two new players before next month's August 9 deadline with Jose Mourinho keen to sign a new centre-back. The Red Devils have been strongly linked with a move for Leicester's ¬£60m-rated Harry Maguire and Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld with Spurs valuing him at over ¬£50m. With Leicester reluctant to sell Maguire and United refusing to meet Alderweireld's asking price, their attentions have turned to Barcelona's Mina. The Colombian made a name for himself at the World Cup, scoring three goals for the South Americans, and his stock has since risen. United, Everton and Wolves are all keen on his services but it looks like United will make the first move. The Sun claim Mourinho's side are preparing an offer of ¬£35m to convince Barcelona to sell. United chiefs have already put in calls to Barca insiders to express their interest and learn the full details of costs. Mina only joined the Catalan giants from Palmeiras at the star of the year but following Barca's acquisition of French star Clement Lenglet he is likely to be deemed surplus to requirements. Barca are thought to be holding out for ¬£50m for the 23-year-old, but The Sun claim Mina is now pleading for the club to lower the asking price and allow him to seal his 'dream move' to United. Speaking on the Sky Sports Transfer Talk podcast, journalist Rob Dorsett recently shed some light on Mina's situation. ""Yerry Mina impressed everybody at the World Cup because he signed from Palmeiras for Barcelona in January for just under ¬£10m and he didn't play a lot,"" he said. ""Only four La Liga starts so nobody really knew that much about him. Then suddenly at the World Cup, three goals, he looks absolutely fantastic including that equaliser against England in injury time. And he's an absolute mountain, isn't he. ""A real physical unit, a really impressive player and we know that Wolves are into him. Wolves have made an enquiry to either take him on loan or a possible permanent transfer as well and we know that Everton are interested too. ""I think that won't be the end of it. I think Wolves and Everton might face some competition, maybe from the bigger teams in the Premier League and also in Spain as well. ""Mina himself has suggested that he might want to leave because he just wants to play football - he hasn't had enough football. ""And he's had that shop window if you like at the World Cup so he could well leave Barcelona."" Mina remains under contract at the Nou Camp until 2023.",FALSE

According to the Sun , Jose Mourinho has switched targets after initially weighing up a move for Leicester's Harry Maguire, but being put off by his ¬£60m price tag. Mina will likely cost a little over half of that fee and is more likely to be available given the fact Barca have now signed Clement Lenglet. The 23-year-old has also been linked with Everton and Wolves, though a potential move to United would almost certainly trump those two options. He cost Barcelona ¬£10.5m when they signed him from Palmeiras in January.",FALSE
651,Manchester United 'agree terms' with Yerry Mina over move from Barcelona,"MANCHESTER UNITED have agreed personal terms with Barcelona star Yerry Mina, it has been claimed. United are interested in signing the Colombia World Cup star as Jose Mourinho desperately looks to strengthen his defensive options. They have turned to the 23-year-old after appearing to have stalled in their attempts to sign Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld. And Mundo Deportivo report that they have got as far as reaching a full agreement with the player over his personal terms ahead of a move to Old Trafford. They suggest all that remains is for United and Barcelona to settle on a price and the move could be sealed by the time the transfer window shuts on Thursday. The La Liga champions are understood to value Mina at ¬£35million and seem prepared to sell despite only signing him six months ago. Barca splashed out ¬£10m to take him to the Nou Camp from Palmeiras in January, though since then he has played just five first team games in all competitions. And having made a major impact at the World Cup with Colombia, the Spanish giants are now entertaining the possibility of cashing in on him now. The 6ft 4in defender was one of the outstanding defenders on show at Russia 2018, and further boosted his profile by scoring three goals including the late equaliser against England in the last-16 clash. He clearly has the physique and pace to cope with the demands of Premier League, and United obviously feel he has proven his quality on the biggest stage. And even at ¬£35m, he would appear a sound investment given Tottenham splashed out ¬£42m to sign his Colombian defensive partner Davinson Sanchez from Ajax 12 months ago. It is Spurs who could hold the key to the Mina deal going through, as they play hardball with unsettled defender Alderweireld. Mourinho has been desperate to bring in the 29-year-old Belgian this summer, but he has been frustrated by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy's tough stance over a fee. Levy wants ¬£75m for a player who has just one year left on his contract in North London, and United do not believe it is a wise financial deal at that price. If the impasse continues over the next few days, the United may be left with no other option than to complete the deal for Mina.",FALSE

Manchester United are set to push hard for Mina, though, who is widely expected to leave Barcelona amid interest from Everton and Lyon. Yet the Manchester Evening News say the Red Devils changed their mind on signing the Colombia international because of Harry Maguire and Toby Alderweireld. The duo were both on United's list of targets at the start of the window. Tottenham, however, are refusing to let Alderweireld go unless Jose Mourinho and Ed Woodward cough up ¬£50million. Leicester have priced them out of a deal for Maguire, too, who blossomed at the World Cup in Russia. The MEN say United changed their mind on Mina, choosing to pursue him despite the 23-year-old not previously being on their list of targets. And a move could be in the offing, with the Red Devils reportedly agreeing personal terms with the Old Trafford outfit. Mina recently played it cool when quizzed on his Barcelona future. ""In terms of my future, I have no idea but I'm calm about it,"" Mina said to Bocas magazine. ""I'm 23 years old and have a lot of football left to play."" Mina also admitted he struggled for Barcelona last season after signing from Palmeiras in January. He added: ""I thought a lot of things, a lot of bad things. I thought I was finished.

Barcelona were said to be hoping for ¬£50 million earlier in the transfer window when Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers expressed interest in him, but Mina ""will plead"" with the club to let him leave for a lower fee so he can secure a switch to Old Trafford. The 23-year-old only arrived at the Camp Nou in January for ¬£10.5 million and made just six appearances for the Blaugrana thereafter, but his value has increased after some strong performances at the FIFA World Cup with Colombia.

Impeccable on both boxes, he'll be excellent in the right setup. While he perhaps lacks the technical skill of fellow Barca centre-backs Gerard Pique and Samuel Umtiti, he's a promising defender who deserves a greater role than he has been given by the Catalan giants. United are in need of defensive reinforcements ahead of the new season, with Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo unreliable.

664,Chelsea transfer news: Eden Hazard to Real Madrid in doubt due to Julen Lopetegui verdict,"Chelsea forward Hazard is on Real Madrid's list of replacements for Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Juventus earlier this summer. The Belgium international, who helped his side finish third at the World Cup in Russia, is determined to seal a move to the Bernabeu. Undeterred by Zinedine Zidane's decision to quit Real, Hazard has already admitted he is ready to leave Chelsea to pursue a new challenge in La Liga. With Neymar out of reach, and Kylian Mbappe also unlikely to leave PSG, Hazard's move to Real has looked a matter of when, not if. But Spanish newspaper Marca say Hazard could yet stay at Chelsea - because of new Real boss Julen Lopetegui. Lopetegui was appointed as Real boss shortly before the World Cup, with Spain sacking him after his move to the capital had been announced. He has already had a problematic first summer at the helm, with Ronaldo's move to Juventus a hammer blow. And he has also had to contend with speculation over Gareth Bale's future, with Manchester United keen to snap him up. Marca claim, though, that Lopetegui is not bothered about signing Hazard. He feels Real have enough attacking options at their disposal, with Marco Asensio and Isco ready to step up. Madrid could instead choose to use funds from Ronaldo's sale on other areas of the squad. Lopetegui has, though, already welcomed two new players to Real's ranks. Vinicius Junior was unveiled at the Bernabeu yesterday, with the 18-year-old held in high regard.

And tensions between the frustrated United boss and chief executive Ed Woodward could see the deal break down. The Mirror claim Leicester will offer Maguire ¬£95k a week - a massive boost to his ¬£45k-a-week wages. Maguire, 25, was a standout performer at the World Cup, scoring against Sweden in the 2-0 quarter-final win. Leicester signed the 6ft 4in centre-back from Hull for ¬£17m last summer. It is claimed Maguire sees United as a ""dream"" move - but will NOT force through a deal. The Foxes are keen to avoid a repeat of the Riyad Mahrez saga, which resulted in him signing for Manchester City for ¬£60m this month . Mahrez handed in a transfer request last May and played one more season before Leicester let him go.

672,Harry Maguire to Manchester United: Is the Leicester defender the man to fix their defence?,"Manchester United are interested in signing Harry Maguire from Leicester, according to Sky Sports News . The England centre-back shone at the World Cup but is he the answer to United's defensive problems? It is only two years since Harry Maguire was considering his future at Hull City having been unable to hold down a starting spot during their promotion-winning Championship campaign. There was interest from Middlesbrough and even talk of a transfer request. Hull rated him highly but would they give him the playing time he wanted in the Premier League? Maguire was 23 at the time and could not have imagined the trajectory his career was about to follow. The decision to stay at Hull was vindicated as he earned a ¬£17m move to Leicester City the following summer, and a year on from that he is a World Cup semi-finalist and a ¬£65m transfer target for Jose Mourinho's Manchester United . United face a major challenge to convince Leicester to sell, but there are other questions to consider too. Is Maguire the right man to reinforce Mourinho's defence? And is he ready for another step up? Nick Wright takes a look with help from Michael Appleton, who worked with him closely as Leicester's assistant manager last season. One area in which Maguire would undoubtedly help United is in the air. 'Slabhead', as he is affectionately nicknamed by team-mates at both Leicester and England, stands at 6ft 4ins and offers formidable aerial strength in both boxes. It's an attribute Mourinho values highly. From John Terry and Didier Drogba at Chelsea to Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku at Manchester United, the Portuguese has always shown a preference for physically imposing players who can dominate their opponents with and without the ball. At United, eight of his 11 signings so far have been at least six feet tall. Maguire certainly fits the bill in that regard, and never has his ability in the air been more apparent than during England's World Cup campaign. The Leicester man was a revelation in Russia, winning more aerial duels (54) than any other defender in the tournament. He was one of the main reasons why England were so effective from set pieces. Maguire seemed to get his head to practically everything, scoring from a header against Sweden and having more penalty-box efforts on goal than Harry Kane, Antoine Griezmann or Mario Mandzukic over the course of the tournament. Mourinho would be eager to harness that set-piece threat at United, who rank a lowly 12th among Premier League sides for goals from corners and free kicks since his appointment in 2016. Maguire, who has scored four times and provided six assists in two seasons in the Premier League, would surely help to make them more potent. Appleton agrees, but warns that Maguire's aerial prowess means he is already subjected to special treatment by Premier League defenders. ""I think the defending from set pieces is much better in the Premier League than what we saw at the World Cup,"" he tells Sky Sports . ""I don't think the movement that got players free at the World Cup would work so well in the Premier League. But having said that, what you tend to find is that they know Harry is going to be the biggest threat, so he gets looked after by more than one player. Sometimes you use him as a decoy. He might make a run to the near post and free up space at the far post."" Maguire's aerial ability is exceptional but one of the question marks over his suitability to an elite team is whether he is mobile enough. In an interview with Sky Sports last season, Mike Phelan, his former coach at Hull, described Maguire as a ""big structure"" who has had to work hard to learn how to manage his sizeable frame. ""He had to work on footwork, technique and the physicality of the game,"" said Phelan. ""Carrying a big frame around with you for 90-odd minutes isn't easy. He had to train hard and work at things like nutrition and diet. Once he felt able to manage all those things, his ability began to come through."" Maguire is usually able to keep pace with opponents when facing the same direction, but Appleton admits his size can make him vulnerable on the turn. ""You look at him and he doesn't often get done for pace,"" says Appleton. ""But when people talk about mobility, I think they mean side-to-side, the twisting and turning. He's a big lad, so it's not always easy for him to manoeuvre his body in that way."" That weakness is not often exposed at Leicester, who tend to sit deep and hit teams on the counter-attack, but Manchester United are more likely to dominate the ball and play higher up the pitch, leaving space behind their defence. That's where Maguire, who averaged fewer sprints per 90 minutes last season than every United centre-back except Phil Jones, could run into trouble. Maguire has shown himself to be adaptable and versatile. He played on the left of a central defensive pair for Leicester last season, but Mourinho will also have noted that he shone in a back three for England at the World Cup. Maguire is a tactically intelligent player who can perform in a variety of different systems. Maguire is even capable of playing in defensive midfield. He was often seen carrying the ball into midfield during the World Cup, but Mourinho will take greater encouragement from how he curbed his attacking instincts at Leicester, learning when to step up and when to play things safe. It's the kind of positional discipline he craves. ""That's one thing we worked on with him, recognising when to step into midfield, because it's different in different games,"" says Appleton. ""When we played the bigger teams we naturally played on the counter-attack, because our opponents had all of the ball, so we would instruct Harry to hold his position. ""But against the smaller sides, he learned to understand that he could play with a bit more freedom. He would step into the middle of the park and one of Wilfried Ndidi or Vincent Iborra would slot back in behind him. He is capable of popping the ball into a midfielder and playing a give-and-go, but he knows when to go and when to stay."" Another of Maguire's strengths is his distribution. The 25-year-old has a fine range of passing and brings composure on the ball. ""That's one of his best attributes, I think,"" says Appleton. ""I think the reason he is so calm on the ball is because he is so calm as a character. It takes a lot to ruffle his feathers and get him wound up."" Maguire is capable of building attacks from deep but the statistics suggest he would have to adapt his style if he were to join Manchester United. While Maguire completed just 78.4 per cent of his passes for Leicester last season, none of United's centre-backs completed less than 82 per cent, with Jones and Victor Lindelof completing more than 90 per cent of theirs. It is partly down to Leicester's more direct approach, but Mourinho would demand a similar level of efficiency from Maguire at United, and he can take encouragement from how the Leicester man adapted for England at the World Cup. Over the course of the tournament with Southgate's side, Maguire completed 88.8 per cent of his passes. Maguire is capable of finding the feet of midfielders and forwards in attacking positions, but he is also capable of picking out team-mates from long-range. Last season, he completed more than three times as many accurate long passes (173) than any United centre-back. It's a weapon which could be useful to Mourinho. It is not difficult to see why Mourinho is interested in Maguire. Buying off the back of a World Cup campaign is a historically risky strategy, but his performances in Russia provided another example of his ability to take new challenges in his stride. His aerial ability, composure and distribution could improve United, but his mobility is potentially problematic, and there are also question marks about his relative inexperience. After only two full seasons as a Premier League player, is Maguire ready to step into Manchester United's defence? ""I think Leicester will do their absolute utmost to make sure he stays there this year and I think that would be a good decision for him,"" says Appleton. ""He's only had two seasons in the Premier League and it wouldn't do him any harm to have another one with Leicester. ""The reality is that the Leicester owners are very ambitious. They have won the title already and they believe they are capable of competing with the top teams on a regular basis. If Harry is going to be in and around the top eight, then he's still at an age where there is plenty of time to work his way further up the ladder in the future. ""As for whether he could play for a team like United now, it's a difficult one. If you had asked me two years ago I probably would have said I couldn't see it, but that's because he had never really had the opportunity to play in the Premier League. That's the thing with a lot of players, you never really know until you give them the opportunity."" Mourinho, it seems, is willing to take that gamble.

673,Man Utd transfer news: Everton prepare bid for Marcos Rojo,"Rojo has not joined United on their US tour, despite Argentina having exited the World Cup exactly a month ago, giving him more than the requisite three-week post-tournament break. Although Rojo signed a new deal in March until 2021 with the option of an extra year, that was done chiefly to protect his market value. As well as Everton , Wolves are understood to have expressed interest in Rojo, but Goodison Park is a more realistic destination for the 27-year-old. Everton have also opened contract talks with England hero Jordan Pickford in a bid to head off interest from Chelsea.

Everton have remained relaxed about the interest in the keeper they snapped up from Sunderland for what now looks like a bargain ¬£30million last sumnmer.

As with all Everton's World Cup contingent, Pickford has been given a strict three-week holiday period following the end of the tournament, meaning he is not yet back on Merseyside. He will be absent when Silva winds up his pre-season against Valencia this weekend, with back-up Maarten Stekelenburg continuing to deputise.

N'Zonzi, who signed for the club for just ¬£7m three years ago, has a ¬£35m release clause written into his contract and in order to think about selling, Sevilla want the release clause to be met. It is believed that Arsenal chiefs have previously been reluctant to shell out the full amount as they do not see N'Zonzi a a primary target. Now, according to France Football , the Gunners are attempting to lower Sevilla's asking price in a bid to complete a deal. N'Zonzi has experience of playing in the Premier League after spells with Blackburn and Stoke and has excelled during his time in La Liga. He has played 136 games for Sevilla in all competitions, scoring eight goals. Emery is still in the process of reshaping the squad he has inherited from Arsene Wenger. The former PSG manager has already brought in Stephan Lichtsteiner, Bernd Leno, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi.

677,Wilfried Zaha transfer: Why the Crystal Palace winger would be a perfect signing for Tottenham Hotspur,"*Sighs* ‚Äì here we go again. It wouldn't be a transfer window without Tottenham Hotspur making things painfully difficult for their fans, would it? With the manager teasing supporters daily with the promise of signings, we sit here with eight days to go and no activity whatsoever. We say it almost every season, but with just a little investment this Tottenham side could be achieving far more than a top three Premier League finish. Our slow starts and strong finishes must scream to the club's hierarchy that there's something missing. Step forward Wilfried Zaha. Big Wilf would be tremendous fun in this Tottenham side. Just picture him flying at defenders and pinging one across to Harry Kane. Delicious. Rarely do clubs sign players who would bring such enormous energy and entertainment to the side. He's hardly box-office, but Zaha's vibrancy would be a delight under Mauricio Pochettino. Like any investment, you've always got to weigh up the pros and cons; the latter being far more prominent with Zaha. The Ivory Coast international had his shot at the big time back in 2013, experiencing an unsuccessful two-year stint at Manchester United. As with many young stars who make the move to a top six side early in their career, the conditions were not in place for him to flourish at Old Trafford. Things would be different this time around at Spurs. As shown over the last few campaigns, Spurs have one of the best attacking quartets in the Premier League. Kane, Dele Alli, Heung-min Son and Christian Eriksen shared 87 goals last season across all competitions, rivalled only by stars of Liverpool and Manchester City. A limitation in what we've seen previously from Zaha is that he's largely operated as the star in a one-man team. Everything went through him at Palace, so how will he work in this system with shared attacking responsibilities? The need for a central midfielder is far more pressing this summer. With Mousa Dembele and Harry Winks plagued by injuries, and the team suffering a few casualties during the pre-season tour , Zaha's role is not something Pochettino should be actively pursuing. However, it wouldn't be Spurs if we weren't prioritising the signing of overpriced wingers now, would it? Whether Spurs can get it done on time is another question altogether. The inevitable low bid of ¬£40million for a ¬£70million-rated player will be the first step on the ladder. Steve Parish knows Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy well, with both knowing a deal will not be done for anything less than the Palace chairman's asking price. Palace making contingencies in the form of Max Meyer and Michail Antonio could suggest they are bracing themselves for a late advance from a big boy. Some have speculated the delay in Spurs pushing for Zaha is down to Levy and United chief executive Ed Woodward playing games with each-other over a potential swap deal involving Toby Alderweireld and Anthony Martial. With just eight days left of the transfer window, these mind games can't continue for much longer. Whisper it quietly, but we may be seeing a lot more of Georges-Kevin N'Koudou this year. After a strong pre-season which saw the Frenchman net two goals in two games during the tour of America, the 23-year-old is desperately trying to cement a place in the senior squad. Should Spurs fail to land Zaha, the youngster may see his first-team chances increase. Just for once, let's have a signing made simply for the sheer fun of it. We've seen over the last year that Zaha is one to raise spirits. With Roy Hodgson's side down in the depths of the league for most of the campaign, he is one to get people on their feet. Spurs have always be known as a team that plays entertaining football, so why not further add to that? With eight days to go, a load of speculation and the inevitable deadline day panic incoming, the fun and games of being a Spurs fan show no signs of slowing up.

Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham are said to be chasing the winger, who impressed under Roy Hodgson last season. And according to the Daily Mirror , the Blues have won the race to sign Zaha. They say the forward has told his Palace team-mates he wants to leave Selhurst Park. The 25-year-old snubbed a new Palace contract in hope of forcing through his exit. The Mirror add that Zaha is considering handing in an official transfer request. Palace are only willing to sell their star man if another club makes a mammoth offer for the forward. Should Chelsea land Zaha, he will become Maurizio Sarri's third summer signing. Jorginho and Rob Green are the Blues' only signings so far, with Sarri keen to splash the cash before the transfer window shuts on August 9. Sarri is also desperately trying to keep hold of Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois this summer. However, the Chelsea boss admits he's in the dark over their futures. ""I will see them on Saturday for the first time - I don't know the situation,"" said Sarri. ""We are talking about top players. Every club wants to keep their top players and we are trying to do it."" Both players hinted at potential exits during the World Cup and Real Madrid are believed to be keen on them. Courtois is the more likely to depart with just one year left on his contract but the Blues are confident Hazard will stay and are preparing to offer him a new deal. Chelsea face Manchester City on Sunday afternoon in the Community Shield as Sarri looks to kick off his Blues spell with silverware.",FALSE
679,"Tottenham boosted as Wilfried Zaha rejects ¬£125,000-a-week contract","Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has rejected a new ¬£125,000-a-week contract to stay in south London in a major boost to both Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur . The Sun understand the 25-year-old wants to play for a 'big club' again and has turned down the Eagles' latest offer as a result. News of Zaha's desire to leave Selhurst Park will pique the interest of long-term suitors Tottenham, who have previously had bids for the Ivory Coast international turned down. But Palace have slapped a ¬£70m price tag on Zaha to warn off any interested parties but it remains to be seen whether that will be enough. Zaha played a pivotal role in Palace beating the drop last season, scoring nine goals and contributing five assists as Roy Hodgson's side survived dropping into the Championship. Tottenham are yet to make a single signing this summer, while their rivals Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have all made additions to their respective squads. They have previously had two bids turned down for Zaha, both of which came last summer, and decided against a January move for the ex-United winger. But reports in February surfaced claiming Tottenham would reignite their interest this summer ‚Äì and the news that a fresh contract has been turned down will only encourage that pursuit. In May 2017, Zaha signed a new five-year contract to commit his future to Palace but his improvement last season following his return from a second knee problem has increased his value. Goals against Bournemouth, Brighton and Hove Albion, Leicester City and then on the final day against West Bromwich Albion proved key in Palace staying in the Premier League, as Hodgson's side secured an 11 th place finish. Yohan Cabaye earlier this summer turned down a new deal with Palace and has joined Al Nasr after three seasons with the club.",FALSE
680,Wilfried Zaha speaks out on rumours he is set to quit Crystal Palace,"Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has clarified comments he posted on social media which seemed to suggest he was ready to leave the south London club for pastures new. Ivory Coast international Zaha has been attracting interest from both Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea over a ¬£70million summer switch, while he is belived to have rejected Palace's latest offer of an improved contract. He sent fans into meltdown early on Friday in a post on his Instagram story, writing: 'Today is the day I make a change with everything.' Having also removed Crystal Palace from his Instagram bio, fans were convinced that Zaha had decided to push for a move ‚Äì but he has now played down that fear and says his comments were unrelated to football. He wrote: 'Let's get this crystal clear, nothing I put on snap is to do with football. 'If I do put something up about football I make sure everyone knows it's football I'm talking about!' Zaha enjoyed an excellent campaign for Palace last season, particularly thriving under Roy Hodgson, and has attracted interest from some of the Premier League's biggest sides. Chelsea are believed to see Zaha as the ideal mix of power and technique to supplement Maurizio Sarri's frontline ‚Äì particularly if Eden Hazard leaves ‚Äì while Spurs boss Mauricio Sarri is a long-time admirer.",FALSE
681,Tottenham transfer news: Wilfried Zaha wants to move to Spurs - but there's a problem,"Zaha, 25, almost single-handedly kept Palace up last season but he now sees his future elsewhere. The Times say Zaha snubbed a new deal and that he is hopeful Tottenham pursue their interest in him. There are even suggestions that Zaha has ALREADY told Crystal Palace he wants to go. However, there is one problem with a potential deal - the asking price Palace are demanding. The ¬£70million valuation is said to have put off Spurs, who may use Moussa Sissoko as a makeweight to get the price down. There is said to be concerns in the Zaha camp when boss Roy Hudgson publicly admitted there is little cash to spend. That, coupled with the fact he said Palace simply want to survive, is seen as a lack of ambition. Zaha was offered a ¬£120,000-a-week deal to stay at Palace. That would have seen him become the club's joint top earner alongside Christian Benteke but Zaha turned it down. Boss Hodgson last said vowed not to sell their star man. He said: ""What people seem to forget with Wilf is he has got a four-year contract. ""There is speculation every year around Messi and Ronaldo too. He is our player for the next four years and the club has got no interest or desire to sell him."" Zaha joined Manchester United for ¬£15million in 2013 but moved back to south London just two seasons later after failing to settle up north. However, he now feels ready for another crack at a top side with Borussia Dortmund also in the frame. Everton, meanwhile, are plotting a part-exchange bid for the player. The Toffees are ready to give Palace the chance to re-sign former Selhurst Park favourite Yannick Bolasie, who they value at around ¬£15m, in a bid to get Zaha in return.",FALSE
682,Tottenham transfer news: Wilfried Zaha speaks out amid Crystal Palace exit rumours,"The south Londoners eased to a 4-0 win over Championship side Reading in a pre-season friendly yesterday. Zaha was in imperious form throughout. The Ivorian bagged two and registered an assist as speculation continues to mount about his future. Speaking after the clash, he said: ""It was good and we are getting back into shape so hopefully we can start the new season how we ended the last one. ""This season I am trying to score a lot more goals and I am just happy that all the hard work I am putting in is showing on the pitch. ""I always try and stay ready so if there was a game tomorrow I would make sure I am ready."" Spurs are yet to make any new signings this summer but have been heavily linked with Zaha. Palace won't let him leave on the cheap though. Roy Hodgson wants at least ¬£70m to part with his prized asset. Despite the speculation, Liverpool legend Steve Nicol isn't convinced the winger will want to move following a tough stint at Manchester United earlier in his career. ""In my opinion, Zaha is absolutely perfect where he is,"" he said on ESPN FC. ""I think when he went to Manchester United , the spotlight was too big for him and he couldn't handle it. ""If Zaha's been offered to Spurs and he has the opportunity, I think he's going to start thinking about Manchester United and how it all went wrong and how he couldn't handle it. ""He's loved at Palace, he's been fantastic at Palace. ""I don't think he's going anywhere, because I don't think he would want to go to Spurs."" Zaha made just four appearances for United during his time at Old Trafford.",TRUE
683,Liverpool transfer news: Have Crystal Palace been put off signing Danny Ings?,"Palace boss Roy Hodgson is believed to be keen on signing the 26-year-old, who is keen to play regular football. Leicester, Newcastle and Southampton are all believed to also be interested in Ings as the transfer window prepares to close on August 9. But Palace may be put off with Liverpool having slapped a ¬£20million valuation on Ings according to the Guardian. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is reportedly keen to keep hold of Ings, though accepts the striker wants to play regular football. Klopp is likely to be busy for the final couple of weeks of the transfer windows as he looks to offload a number of players. The German has brought in four players this summer and will now look to trim his squad back down. Emre Can has already left Anfield with Jon Flanagan and Harry Wilson also departing. Daniel Sturridge is one that has been linked to a move away from Anfield having been sent on loan to West Brom last season. And former Reds star Steve Nicol believes the English striker should leave, but may find it tricky. ""I've been saying for two years that Daniel Sturridge should go,"" Nicol told ESPN FC. ""So no surprise, Daniel Sturridge should go. But he isn't going anywhere by the way, no chance. ""The money he's on, nobody's buying him.""",TRUE

The Eagles are looking to add firepower to their frontline following Christian Benteke's profligate campaign last time out. Manager Roy Hodgson is keen on landing Ings, 26, who appears to have put his previous injury woes behind him. The England international's tireless work rate is also a huge positive, leading to Liverpool's ¬£20million valuation of the player, but Crystal Palace are yet to match it.

685,Report: Liverpool Demand ¬£20M for Danny Ings Amid Crystal Palace Rumours,"Crystal Palace have reportedly stepped up their efforts to sign Liverpool 's Danny Ings but will have to meet the Reds' ¬£20 million price tag if they are to snap up the striker. According to Andy Hunter of the Guardian , the south London side will also have to compete with Leicester City , Newcastle United and Southampton , who are also interested in the former Burnley man, whose Liverpool career has been dogged by injury. Ings, 26, joined Liverpool in 2015 after a fine debut season in the Premier League with Burnley. However, he picked up an anterior cruciate ligament injury almost immediately after the appointment of Jurgen Klopp as manager in October 2015, and he has barely played since. His Premier League record in three years at Anfield reads 14 games played, three goals scored, one assist provided. In his absence, Klopp's Liverpool have progressed hugely, and even when fully fit, Ings would struggle for any regular first-team action in the front line. As a result, per Hunter, Ings has decided he must leave Anfield and will seemingly have his pick of a number of mid-table Premier League clubs. Per Goal's Neil Jones, the route between Liverpool and Palace has been well trodden of late: Crystal Palace keen on Danny Ings but #LFC firm in their belief they can and will get ¬£20m for him. Interest from elsewhere too, including Leicester, Newcastle, Southampton. Benteke, Sakho, Ings? They've done well out of Palace, transfer-wise, in recent seasons. Ings is still young enough to salvage a career that has stagnated in the last few years. And the numerous Premier League clubs interested in signing him is a clear indication that he still has plenty to offer.",FALSE
686,Arsenal transfer news: Gunners star wants Ousmane Dembele from Barcelona 'at all costs',"The France international is expected to leave Barcelona this summer after struggling to make an impact during his first season at the Nou Camp. Dembele was brought in a year ago for ¬£135.5m as a replacement for Neymar but injuries and the January arrival of Philippe Coutinho saw his playing time limited. The 21-year-old has been heavily linked with an exit this summer, with Liverpool and Manchester United among the Premier League sides interested. But Arsenal appear to be leading the race for his signature and Dembele sparked speculation this week after being pictured with several Gunners stars, including Aubameyang. The pair were team-mates at Borussia Dortmund and Aubameyang has spoken in the past about his interest in playing with him again. And according to Don Balon , a Spanish outlet famous for its outlandish transfer claims, the Gabon international has urged Arsenal to snap him up before Thursday's deadline. The report claims Aubameyang wants Dembele 'at all costs' and Arsenal made a bid this week, offering Aaron Ramsey as a makeweight in the deal. Don Balon claim Unai Emery wants Dembele not only to please Aubameyang but also to get rid of Ramsey. The Welshman is out of contract next summer and is yet to sign a new deal so Arsenal would prefer to use him to get Dembele for a lower fee, rather than lose him for free.",FALSE
687,Barcelona transfer news: Arsenal want Ousmane Dembele but deal can only happen one way,"Barcelona forward Dembele has been heavily linked with Arsenal as speculation over his Nou Camp future continues to rumble on. The France international could leave the Nou Camp in the wake of the Catalan giants' signing of Malcom, who signed from Bordeaux at the end of last month. However, Football London have now shed some light on whether or not a move to Arsenal from Barcelona can actually happen. Dembele has sent fans into overdrive by being snapped in London with Gunners stars Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. Yet journalist Charles Watts, talking in a Twitter Q&A, says Arsenal will only be able to land Dembele on loan - and that looks a stretch. He told Football London when asked how close the Gunners were to signing Dembele: ""Not close. ""Sven Mislintat would love to get him, but Barca are adamant he is not going anyway. ""Should that stance change and he suddenly become available next week, then I'm sure Arsenal would ask the question - but I can't see anyway how it could be any other deal other than a loan. They just couldn't afford him. ""I wouldn't get your hopes up."" Dembele signed for Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund in a huge ¬£134million deal last summer. He failed to hit the heights many expected, though, hitting just four goals across all competitions. Reports in the past have claimed Ernesto Valverde has lost patience with Dembele - which is why he went for Malcom. But, speaking last week, Valverde labelled the 21-year-old as 'extraordinary.' ""Let's hope it's his season,"" said Valverde. ""He is an extraordinary player. The past year has been complicated because of the injuries, but even so he has brought us a lot. ""The important thing is that there is competition within the team. There are a lot of matches and we can not handle them with only eleven players."" Arsenal have already made five signings so far this summer. Stephan Lichtsteiner, Bernd Leno, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi have all arrived. Unai Emery would love to sign a winger, though, but Dembele seems out of his reach for now.",FALSE
688,Arsenal transfer news: Barcelona would consider Ousmane Dembele sale for one reason,"Arsenal would relish the chance to sign Dembele who, despite joining Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund a year ago, may be on the move. The France international struggled under Ernesto Valverde last season and, with Malcom since arriving at the Nou Camp from Bordeaux, a move away could be on the cards. And Catalan newspaper Mundo Deportivo say Barcelona feel selling Dembele may be a money-spinner. Arsenal are leading the charge for the 21-year-old's signature with the club keen to sign a right winger. The Gunners have enjoyed a fine first transfer window under Unai Emery but know they need more stardust if they are to challenge for the Premier League title. The report suggests Dembele, for now, is staying at Barcelona. However, Mundo Deportivo say they are open to doing business as they believe they can fetch a huge fee for the teenager. It cost the La Liga giants a massive ¬£134million to prise him away from Borussia Dortmund a year ago. And, in order to even consider letting him go, they are likely to demand a huge fee. Barcelona could use funds from any potential sale on Paul Pogba, something that has been reported in Spain. But whether the France star opts to sign for Arsenal remains to be seen. Fans were recently sent into a frenzy after images of Dembele with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alexandre Lacazette surfaced online. Arsenal also need to sell before buying and time is running out with the transfer window closes for English teams to buy players on Thursday. Express Sport understands, however, that Dembele being snapped with Arsenal players had nothing to do with a transfer. Valverde, meanwhile, recently tipped his Barcelona wing wizard to come good. ""Let's hope it's his season,"" he said. ""He is an extraordinary player. The past year has been complicated because of the injuries, but even so he has brought us a lot .

689,"Gareth Bale very happy to remain at Real Madrid, says new coach Julen Lopetegui","J ulen Lopetegui is adamant Gareth Bale will not be leaving Real Madrid as he backed the Wales international to fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale had declared after scoring two goals in Real's Champions League final victory over Liverpool back in May that he was thinking about leaving the club because he had spent most of the season on the bench. That had fuelled talk of the 29-year-old returning to the Premier League with Manchester United, but Bale is willing to remain in Spain for at least another season following the departure of manager Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo, who has left for Juventus. And former Spain boss Lopetegui, who was sacked just days before the start of the World Cup after agreeing to succeed Zidane at Bernabeu, revealed there is no chance the former Tottenham Hotspur star will be leaving in this transfer window. ""He's very, very happy,"" said Lopetegui ahead of Real's friendly against United in Miami. ""He's very happy to play at Real Madrid. He's happy to be here, this is a fantastic opportunity for him to show his talent. ""I've talked to him like I've talked to everyone. He's with the team, he's happy, he's in line with our goals and it's a start of a new exciting path for us that I'm looking forward to.

690,"Gareth Bale 'Very Happy' at Real Madrid Amid Exit Rumours, Says Julen Lopetegui","Real Madrid manager Julen Lopetegui has said Gareth Bale is happy at the club amid continued speculation regarding his future. Bale was often on the fringes of the squad last season under Zinedine Zidane, as he struggled with injuries and his form fluctuated. However, following the summer departures of Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo, it's anticipated the Welshman will have a more prominent role at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""He's very, very happy,"" said Lopetegui, per Luke Edwards of the Daily Telegraph . ""He's very happy to play at Real Madrid. He's happy to be here, this is a fantastic opportunity for him to show his talent."" It's been reported by The Sun (h/t Owen Fulda of the Daily Star ) that Bale is potentially in line for a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu. According to the report, having been told he is a crucial part of the side by Lopetegui, Bale is happy to open fresh talks with Madrid over an extension next summer. The Welshman signed a new contract with the European champions in October 2016 up until 2022. As noted by Edwards, following his two-goal heroics in the UEFA Champions League final against Liverpool in May, Bale cast doubt over his future, saying it was important he played more football in the coming campaign. ""That had fuelled talk of the 29-year-old returning to the Premier League with Manchester United, but Bale is willing to remain in Spain for at least another season,"" added Edwards. The Red Devils and Real will meet one another on Tuesday night in Miami in the International Champions Cup. With Ronaldo gone there is a chance for Bale to take on more responsibility in the final third under the new manager. As relayed by Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News , Lopetegui believes Real can cope despite the departure of Ronaldo: Lopetegui on Bale replacing Ronaldo: 'When it comes to our players, Bale and everyone else, we have the players to move forward. Bale is a magnificent player and we are convinced he and everyone else can fill the void.' #mufc Whether Bale can fill those boots on his own remains a big doubt, though, as the Welshman didn't have the best campaign before his remarkable outing in Kiev. Under Zidane he was usurped by Isco at the back end of the 2016-17 season, with the Spain international excelling in an attacking midfield role and helping Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double. In the campaign just gone Bale found it tough to find a role in the side too. He played on either flank and through the middle at times, although he was regularly pulled out of the side or saw any progress halted due to injury. Still, as noted by football writer Tom Williams, overall the accomplishments of Bale in the Spanish capital have been remarkable: Three key goals in Champions League final wins (2014 and 2018), one a worldie. Four Champions League trophies in five years (and one Liga). And semi-finals of Euro 2016 with Wales. Forget the injuries and Bernabeu boos - Gareth Bale is one of Britain's greatest ever footballers. The Champions League final in Kiev epitomised what Bale is capable of. Not only did he score one of the all-time great final goals with his stunning overhead kick, he terrorised the opposition defence with his physicality and speed. When he puts it all together, Bale is a force of nature in the final third, and the challenge for him now will be to show those traits over the course of an entire campaign. In a campaign that's poised to be one of transition for Real, it would be a boost to Lopetegui if he was able to do so.",TRUE

Instead, The Mirror report that the Hornets are interested in taking the 23-year-old on a season-long loan deal. It's despite Watford earning a rumoured ¬£40m in the sale of Richarlison to Everton this week. Origi has struggled during his time at Liverpool and was sent on loan to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg last season. Origi has featured for Liverpool during pre-season but Jurgen Klopp seems to be favouring Daniel Sturridge as back-up to Roberto Firmino.

Following the ¬£40m sale of Richarlison, Watford are certainly not strapped for cash and are now in the hunt for another forward player. But the London side seem reluctant to spend such a large chunk of that incoming cash on the 23-year-old.

However, after several disappointing performances throughout last season, Bakayoko was left out of the starting line-up on numerous occasions. Reports suggest that new Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri is intending to axe the midfielder as he looks to tailor his squad for next season. Having already signed Jorginho in a ¬£57million deal from former club Napoli, Sarri wants to clear out fringe players too. Now, according to Spanish publication Estadio Deportivo , Sevilla have made initial contact about signing Bakayoko on a season-long loan with a later option to buy. The Spaniards have in return received positive feedback that a deal could be possible. The player is first believed to want assurances over his first-team place at Chelsea under the new regime and will hold talks with Sarri before making a final decision on his future. Despite signing Ibrahim Amadou, Sevilla are likely to further strengthen their midfield if Steven Nzonzi leaves the club. Nzonzi performed well for France at the World Cup in Russia and may be set to move on. Sarri is also believed to be casting a close eye over other players that Conte was instrumental in signing for Chelsea. That puts the likes of Spanish striker Alvaro Morata in the firing line, whose future is in serious doubt. Meanwhile, skipper Gary Cahill is considering his future after six years at the club.",FALSE
721,Tiemoue Bakayoko looking to leave Chelsea as Sevilla step up negotiations,"Tiemoue Bakayoko has told Maurizio Sarri that he wants to leave Chelsea this summer, according to reports in Spain. The 23-year-old signed from Monaco for ¬£40 million last summer but struggled to make an impact in his first season at Stamford Bridge. Estadio Deportivo reports that Sevilla have stepped up their pursuit of Bakayoko as they are looking to replace Steven N'Zonzi before the transfer window closes. Sevilla have already held talks with Bakayoko's representatives and the midfielder has told Sevilla that he would be willing to join them. Bakayoko has also reportedly informed Sarri that he wants to leave to boost his chances of getting more playing time. The France international, who missed out on a place in this summer's World Cup squad, faces increased competition for his position following Chelsea's decision to sign Jorginho from Napoli. Bakayoko will also face further competition from Ross Barkley, who is back to full fitness after his start at Chelsea had been hampered by a hamstring injury. Bakayoko is in pre-season training with Chelsea and came on for Jorginho at half-time in the 1-0 victory over Perth Glory on Monday.",FALSE
722,Manchester United Transfer News: Ernesto Valverde Discusses Paul Pogba Rumours,"Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde has discussed speculation linking his side with a move for Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba . Pogba has reportedly already met with Barcelona director of football Eric Abidal, and Valverde was asked about the prospect of the Frenchman moving to the Camp Nou, per Metro : ""Pogba is a great player who is on another team and we are always very respectful of the players on other teams. We respect the player and the teams they are on. ""Is the transfer market closed for signing more players? We'll see how the market is going, but I'm the coach and my idea is to take advantage of the players we have."" Pogba endured a difficult season at Manchester United as he was dropped on several occasions by manager Jose Mourinho. However, he flourished during the summer and helped France win the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. There is no doubting Pogba's talent, but he has been unable to reproduce his best form consistently since returning to Manchester United from Juventus in 2016. Manager Mourinho has challenged Pogba to reproduce his international form at club level. ""I don't think it's about us getting the best out of him. It's about him giving the best he has to give,"" he told ESPN (h/t Jamie Jackson of the Guardian ). Pogba still managed to contribute 10 assists and six goals in the Premier League last season.

Double figures. üëå https://t.co/Jq5zNTA2XZ The France international was offered to Barcelona after the World Cup by agent Mino Raiola. The midfielder is said to be open to the move, per Mundo Deportivo (h/t Liam Prenderville at the Mirror ). Barcelona have been busy in the transfer market this summer after seeing midfielders Andres Iniesta and Paulinho depart the Camp Nou. The Spanish champions have brought in Arthur from Gremio, Bordeaux winger Malcom and Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich. Central defender Clement Lenglet has also arrived from Sevilla. The club have also been linked with a move for either Ajax midfielder Frenkie De Jong or Paris Saint-Germain's Adrien Rabiot, per AS (h/t Football Espana ). Midfield has clearly been the focus for Barcelona in this transfer window, and Pogba has the technical ability to slot in at the Camp Nou. However, the club have already splashed out this summer on four signings, and they may find it difficult to find the huge sum needed to prise Pogba away from Manchester United.",FALSE

The French midfielder's agent Mino Raiola was last night trying to engineer a move away from Old Trafford as he held talks with the club . Barcelona are believed to be keen to snap up the ¬£89million star, who returned to Carrington for training on Monday. Raiola would love to make the deal happen ‚Äî although he faces a huge battle to persuade United to sell with no time to find a replacement. The Premier League 's transfer window shuts on Thursday, although Spanish clubs have until the end of August to sign players. SunSport reported last month ‚Äî on World Cup final day ‚Äî Pogba's agent had approached Barca, while Juventus were also keen to re-sign him. Back in April, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola revealed Raiola had been in touch with them regarding Pogba. United insisted Pogba, 25, was not for sale and their stance has not shifted since then. But the fact Raiola, who was in the north-west yesterday, is trying so hard will only increase the belief the players wants out of United after just two years. There has been little sign of a thaw in the frosty relationship between Pogba and Jose Mourinho this summer. The Portuguese boss stopped short of praising his midfielder for his starring role in Russia. He said: ""I don't think it's about us getting the best out of him, it's about him giving the best he has to give‚Ä¶ ""I think the World Cup is the perfect habitat for a player like him to give their best. ""Why? Because it's closed for a month, where he can only think about football. ""During a season, you can have a big match then a smaller match, then one even smaller, then you can lose your focus."" Mourinho has tried various ways of getting the best out of Pogba. And the hope is the arrival of ¬£52m Brazilian Fred will allow Les Bleus ace more freedom. However Pogba missed the whole of pre-season due to his involvement in the World Cup. And he took three weeks off following the celebrations in Paris ‚Äî leaving him little time to get match fit before the season starts on Friday. Mourinho also made pointed remarks about some of his World Cup players returning early while others took their full allocation of holiday. Meanwhile, Leicester remain adamant their England World Cup star Harry Maguire will NOT be a United player by the time they visit Old Trafford for Friday night's Prem curtain-raiser. Mourinho is desperate to strengthen his defence with Maguire and ¬£44m-rated Bayern Munich centre-half Jerome Boateng prime targets. Even if Mourinho's moneymen do try to tempt the Foxes with a record ¬£76m bid for Maguire, they will dig their heels in.

According to the Daily Mail 's Chris Wheeler , Raiola has held ""detailed discussions"" with Barca, who are said to have had a bid of ¬£44.6 million plus Andre Gomes and Yerry Mina turned down by United. Sources close to Pogba have confirmed reports that Raiola will also hold talks with the Red Devils about his client's future, as well as the midfielder's openness to moving on from Old Trafford. United can continue to sell players until the end of the month, but as their deadline to bring in any replacements is 5 p.m. BST on Thursday, Pogba and his representatives understand that at this point an exit will be difficult to secure this summer. That will particularly be the case if the details of Barca's reported offer are accurate, per sports writer Jonas Giaever: Barcelona signed Coutinho for a reported ‚Ç¨140m and Ousmane Demb√©l√© for a reported ‚Ç¨105m. To bid ‚Ç¨50m + two players they have been open to moving the entire summer for a player like Paul Pogba seems incredibly disrespectful. To both the player and Man United. Very bizarre. James Benge of the Evening Standard can understand why Pogba might want to move on, though: If I were in Pogba's situation I'd be instructing my agent to find a way out for me. Can't be an enjoyable workplace to be in. The 25-year-old's relationship with United manager Jose Mourinho has been rocky at times since the player returned to the club from Juventus in 2016. The coach has not been afraid to publicly criticise the star, who has struggled to consistently produce his best form in a United shirt. Per Wheeler, even after Pogba helped France win the FIFA World Cup and had an excellent tournament from an individual standpoint, Mourinho said: "" I don't think it's about us getting the best out of him; it's about him giving the best he has to give."" Football writer Tom McDermott feels the reality is somewhere in the middle, with both player and manager having to bear some responsibility: Who takes blame for Pogba not playing to potential? Mourinho, or the player himself? Probably a bit of both, but as we saw before the World Cup, Pogba received criticism from French supporters but somehow Didier Deschamps managed to get the best out of him at tournament. #MUFC The club may be yet to see the best of Pogba ‚Äîat least beyond the occasional flash of talent ‚Äîbut he's nevertheless a vital player at Old Trafford whose performances will play a large part in determining their success this season. That seems to be recognised by the club, as according to Sport 's Lluis Miguelsanz , they are adamant he will not be sold and Barcelona "" consider the move for Pogba dead in the water"" as a result.

Football writer Liam Canning believes that Pogba cannot be allowed to depart this summer: Think the daftest thing Manchester United could ever do is sell Paul Pogba this summer. No idea if Pogba and Mourinho are on good terms, but selling simply cannot be an option. They need him to have a big season. Mourinho has struggled to get the best out of the Frenchman since his return to Old Trafford in 2016, but the midfielder showed what he's capable of at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, where he put in a series of strong performances to help France win the tournament. If the manager can get the same tune out of him for United, he could be a force to be reckoned with for the Red Devils. Per Rafael Hernandez of Barca fansite Grup 14, Barcelona are admirers of the playmaker, but a deal cannot be quickly completed: Pogba rumours are more motivated by Mino Raiola than Barcelona's interest in the player, which exists but his signing is an operation that would take weeks to come to happen, due to his long term contract with Manchester United and his astronomical salary. United can still sell players after the August 9 deadline, but they're unlikely to part with a key player when they won't be able to replace him until January at the earliest. Even if a sale could be completed in the coming days, it would give them little time to bring in a player of similar calibre before the deadline, so a last-minute departure seems unlikely.",FALSE
726,Man Utd transfer news: Barcelona told Paul Pogba development by Mino Raiola,"Manchester United midfielder Pogba is a top Barcelona transfer target with the Catalan giants keen to rescue him from his Old Trafford nightmare. The France international, who impressed as his side won the World Cup in Russia earlier this summer, is reportedly keen to leave the Premier League behind. Manchester United invested ¬£89million to sign Pogba two years ago but the player has struggled to hit the heights many expected, repeatedly clashing with Jose Mourinho. And Catalan newspaper Sport say Raiola has contacted Barcelona to deal them a hammer blow. Pogba's importance to United goes beyond what he does on the pitch. The 25-year-old is seen as the face of the club and, as a result, a commercial and financial goldmine. Despite toiling for United, his stock has never been higher too. Pogba looks out of his depth in red but, in the blue of France, rediscovered his mojo at the World Cup this summer. And Sport claim Raiola has told Barcelona they do not have the financial muscle to sign him. It is said the super-agent views the feasibility of a deal as 'impossible,' despite the midfielder's supposed dream of playing alongside Lionel Messi. And, as a result, Barcelona are looking at alternatives. The priority is reportedly Ajax youngster Frenkie De Jong, who is viewed as one of Dutch football's most promising midfielders. Signing him, though, will be no easy task. The Eredivisie side want to keep him for another year before allowing him to join Barcelona in a year's time. Ajax director Marc Overmars said of De Jong last month: ""Let them [any interested clubs] come back next year. ""Let the players play 40 games with Ajax this year. They'll not be allowed to leave, even for crazy amounts."" As for Pogba, a United stay beckons. But whether he can heal his well-publicised rift with Mourinho is something only time will tell.

But his agent's movement has indicated that Pogba wants out of the club after a tense second season back under Jose Mourinho. However, according to the Daily Mail , United believe Raiola could be trying to get Pogba more money. Pogba was usurped as United's highest-paid player in January when Alexis Sanchez signed from Arsenal. He tried to get parity at the time and United suspect this may be a move to get him back to the top of the club's rich list. Pogba returned to training on Monday following an extended break after the World Cup and Jose Mourinho hopes he is available for play on Friday. United start the season against Leicester on Friday at Old Trafford. The Portuguese has also appealed to Romelu Lukaku, Marouane Fellaini, Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young to make themselves available after late returns. Marcus Rashford, Victor Lindelof and Phil Jones all returned early from their holidays last week and gained some vital minutes of match action in Munich and now Mourinho wants more of his Russia contingent to do the same. ""Rashford will be in a better situation [on Friday] than against Munich, Lindelof and Jones the same,"" he said. ""The others are back on Monday. Let's see if one of the others is ready to give a help, 20-25 minutes, against Leicester. Any help that can come from them is welcome."" Nemaja Matic is out while Eric Baily and Ander Herrera are doubtful and Anthony Martial's future is uncertain. Mourinho remains hopeful of landing one final signing before Thursday's transfer deadline.

Mourinho added: ""My CEO [Ed Woodward], he knows what I want for quite a long time, he knows what I want. ""I know that he tries the best for me. I still have a few days to wait to see what is going to happen. If we don't make our team better it will be a difficult season for us.""

Pogba's agent, Mino Raiola, is currently in Manchester in a bid to push the complicated operation forward. Despite having ended their relationship with the Romanian agent after his involvement in Zlatan Ibrahimovic's controversial exit from the club , Barcelona have been forced to work with Riola again, as they are aware that he is key to any hope of securing a deal for the Frenchman. Other key factors in this operation which could work in Barca's favor are the apparently strained relationship between Pogba and United boss Jose Mourinho , and the French midfielder's fervent desire to play with Lionel Messi, something which he has reiterated on a number of occasions. After meeting with Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu, Raiola has been entrusted to present the club's offer to the board at Old Trafford, which is understood to be in the region of 112 million euros (around the same amount that Barcelona were prepared to pay Atl√©tico Madrid for Antoine Griezmann). Bartomeu could also include the likes of Yerry Mina or Andre Gomes to sweeten the deal for Mourinho. Barcelona, however, will face stiff competition from Juventus , who are reportedly keen to bring Pogba back to Turin. The Italian club will hope that a nostalgic desire to return to Italy and the country's generous tax incentives ( reportedly a factor in Cristiano Ronaldo's decision to move to Turin ) could sway Pogba's decision.

The 26-year-old has entered the final year of his deal at Chelsea and has intimated that he will walk away for free next summer if he's not allowed to join Real Madrid. Courtois has had his heart set on a return to Spain for the last 12 months as his children currently reside in Madrid. Maurizio Sarri confirmed on Friday that he was hopeful that Courtois will stay but the Belgian's agent has revealed he's asked to leave and told Chelsea to accept Madrid's offer. 'I have been reading everywhere that Chelsea are saying it is up to Thibaut, but he has made it clear to the club that the best option for him is to move to Madrid,' Christophe Henrotay told the Sun . 'For him this is a big decision because he wants to be near his family, and there is an offer in place for Chelsea to accept.' Sarri had suggested that it was up to Courtois to hand in a transfer request in order for him to force through the move. 'At the moment Courtois is the goalkeeper of the club, of Chelsea, and so I don't know in the future. It depends on the club,' said Sarri. 'It depends especially on him I think.

737,Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois wants Real Madrid move - agent,"Thibaut Courtois has told Chelsea that he wants to join Real Madrid this summer for family reasons, his agent Christophe Henrotay has said. Chelsea are reluctant to sell goalkeeper Courtois, who is in the final year of his contract, without first securing a replacement, but their top target Alisson was signed for ¬£65 million by Liverpool last month. Courtois has made no secret of his desire to spend more time with his two children who live with his former partner in Madrid, and also told Marca in September 2016 that he considers himself ""half-Spanish"" after spending three years on loan with Atletico. Numerous reports have suggested that Madrid have offered ¬£35m for Courtois, and Henrotay urged Chelsea to take their goalkeeper's wishes into consideration. ""I have been reading everywhere that Chelsea are saying it is up to Thibaut, but he has made it clear to the club that the best option for him is to move to Madrid,"" he told The Sun . ""For him this is a big decision because he wants to be near his family, and there is an offer in place [from Madrid] for Chelsea to accept. ""We have seen suggestions that it is about money, and it is true he could get an increase with a move. But he has turned down a better offer elsewhere because this is more than a financial decision. ""Throughout this it has important for everyone to be reasonable, and the buying club has come up with a reasonable offer for a player who has one year left on his contract when they know they could sign him without a fee in 12 months. ""Chelsea could get a fair fee for him now and sign a replacement. Or they would still have to sign a replacement next summer, but without getting a fee for Thibaut. ""It is understandable people might be upset because he wants to leave the club, we accept that. But this is a human decision based on someone wanting to be close to his children -- and that is a reasonable thing too."" Courtois is due back at Chelsea for preseason training on Monday, and speaking at a news conference ahead of the Community Shield against Manchester City on Sunday, new head coach Maurizio Sarri said he would like the Belgian to stay.

738,Chelsea transfer news: Thibaut Courtois in Spain? Real Madrid rumours grow as photo shared,"An image of Courtois purportedly in Tenerife was posted on Twitter today by an account representing a branch of supermarket Spar on the Spanish island. And that has fuelled rumours the 26-year-old is heading to Real after it was reported he has gone AWOL after opting against returning to Chelsea training. However, it has emerged everything is not as it seems, despite the fact Courtois has not made his way back to London following a post-World Cup break. Belgian journalist Kristof Terreur has debunked the claims by revealing when the picture was probably taken instead. Hoy hemos recibido la visita de Thibaut Courtois en nuestro #SparMar_Bella . Muchas gracias por ser tan amable y simp√°tico con nosotr@s. #SiempreCercadeTi pic.twitter.com/QlNmGzPrMg ""Thibaut Courtois was in Tenerife last week,"" wrote Terreur on Twitter . ""On holiday with his kids. ""He's not in Tenerife right now, neither in Madrid. #CFC"" Courtois' desire to return to Spain, where he played on loan for Atletico Madrid and his children live is very real. His agent, Christophe Henrotay, confirmed as much in an impassioned statement urging Chelsea to sell last week. Maurizio Sarri made it clear after the Community Shield defeat to Manchester City that he wants to speak to Courtois face-to-face. ""I have no reaction on the agent,"" said Sarri on Sunday. ""I am not interested in the agent. I want to hear from Courtois. ""If Courtois says the same tomorrow [Monday] I have to speak with my club of course, because I want only players with a very high level of motivation. But I have nothing to add to the agent."" However, Courtois has dodged Sarri's invitation to chat over his future by failing to return to Chelsea's Cobham base. Courtois, who skipped the Community Shield, was meant to join Gary Cahill, Eden Hazard, N'Golo Kante, Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi at a training session late on Monday afternoon. But he is attempting to force Chelsea into selling him this summer amid interest from Real Madrid , who are eager to make him their new No 1. Real have slapped in a ¬£35m bid for Courtois which Chelsea will likely accept due to the former Genk ace having just 12 months on his contract. Chelsea, though, are making Real wait as they want to secure Courtois' replacement before they will sanction his exit. Stoke's Jack Butland has risen to the top of Chelsea's wanted list as they reluctantly prepare to wave goobye to Courtois. The England international is keen to return to the Premier League and the Potters could accept an offer of around ¬£25m for him. Everton's Jordan Pickford was also on Chelsea's radar but the Toffees will rebuff any bids before Thursday's 5pm transfer deadline.

The Chelsea keeper skipped training, despite new Blues boss Maurizio Sarri announcing on Sunday he wanted showdown talks with his wantaway star. Courtois was meant to be in at 4pm along with Chelsea's other World Cup players, such as Eden Hazard, N'Golo Kante, Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud . The Belgium star was also due for talks with boss Maurizio Sarri and was expected to demand a move. Yet sources close to Courtois claim the pair spoke last week, with Sarri telling the player he did not want him around the squad while not totally focused. And Chelsea want ¬£50million for the Belgian, 26, who is out of contract next summer. But David Luiz claims Chelsea can cope without the stopper. Chelsea team-mate Hazard has also expressed a desire to leave but is set to stay as Real have not followed up their interest. And Brazilian defender Luiz said: "" Chelsea want the best players to stay. They know Chelsea a lot, so they know what they've had here, the fun they've had here. Everybody loves them and I hope they can stay. ""Chelsea has a fantastic squad, with fantastic players. I want them to stay, because we have top players with the confidence. If they decide to leave, I think we will continue with fantastic players."" Chelsea turned down a ¬£35million bid for Courtois in June and could wait until August 31 to sell him as the Spanish window does not close until then. But they are now in a frantic race against time to find a replacement as the Premier League window shuts on THURSDAY. Stoke No 1 Jack Butland and Sevilla's Sergio Rico are on their shortlist. Chelsea are expected to bid for Butland, who wants a return to the Premier League, but the pair are not the only names on the club's radar. The Blues' only current keepers are Willy Caballero, who played in Sunday's 2-0 Community Shield defeat to Manchester City, and former England ace Rob Green, 38, who Chelsea have signed on a one-year contract after he left Huddersfield. SunSport revealed on Saturday that Courtois' agent, Christophe Henrotay, had urged Chelsea to let the player go. Courtois attended a function in Belgium on Sunday in which he was honoured by former club Genk. The 26-year-old claimed he would take the Eurostar on Monday and be at the Cobham training ground but delivered a no-show. Courtois ‚Äî named the best goalkeeper at the World Cup in Russia ‚Äî used a similar tactic to force his move from Atletico Madrid to Chelsea by not turning up for a friendly game against Lyon. Ironically, the Blues play French side Lyon tonight in an International Champions Cup clash tie. Courtois' family has remained in Madrid and he is determined to join them. One player staying at Chelsea is Luiz's fellow Brazilian Willian. After the Community Shield defeat, Willian said: ""I've always been very happy playing for Chelsea. I never said that I want to leave the club. ""This is a new era, with a new manager, and I've had a good conversation with him. I hope we can enjoy a lot of victories."" Luiz, 31, is delighted that Willian is set to stay. The defender added: ""He's a fantastic player and a fantastic friend. ""I've known Willian since I was eight. Chelsea loves Willian and Willian loves Chelsea, so to leave Chelsea would be something totally out of the reality."" Luiz hopes new boss Sarri will not need time to bed in at the West London club. He said: ""I hope not. I hope we can fight for all the titles. When you play for a big club you have to be ready to try to fight for the titles, and we're going to fight for that. Winning the title is our goal and we're going to work on that. ""At the moment I'm in love with Sarri's philosophy, with the way he works, the way he is training, the way he loves football.

I progressed a lot as a player and as a person by playing with the best players in the world."" Digne becomes the second signing made by new Everton boss Marco Silva following the arrival of Richarlison from Watford . According to Phil Kirkbride of the Liverpool Echo , the Merseyside club have agreed an ¬£18 million deal with the La Liga champions for Digne, although that may rise to ¬£20 million due to add-ons. The switch brings an end to two years at the Camp Nou for the 25-year-old, in which he struggled to force his way into the side at the expense of Jordi Alba. Barcelona posted the following clip of Digne reflecting on his time at the club: üîµüî¥Thanks for everything and good luck, @LucasDigne! https://t.co/nQ8EM1bX2S Previously Digne had a spell with Roma on loan having struggled to cement a first-team place at Paris Saint-Germain.

Digne has the attributes to be a fine left-back for the Blues. Throughout his career he has showcased he has energy, tenacity and is intelligent enough to link up with attackers when he does overlap in the final third. However, given he's been a fringe player at PSG and Barcelona, he hasn't had a consistent foundation upon which to showcase those talents regularly. At Everton he will face some competition for his place in the team from veteran Leighton Baines . Ian Croll of the Liverpool Echo thinks the transfer is ideal given Baines will turn 34 in December: Digne is the ideal left-back signing for #EFC. Not a young understudy with potential with a view to eventually taking over from Baines. Not an old guard defender who will slip in when Baines is injured. Right age, right calibre. Has the quality now, when it's needed most. Silva can at least be content he now has two quality options in the position and will hope Digne is able to strike up an understanding with new man Richarlison down the left flank. Digne may not be the only man to trade the Camp Nou for Goodison Park this summer either. As noted by Kirkbride, Everton are also trying to wrap up a deal for Barcelona centre-back Yerry Mina.",TRUE

But Leicester are refusing to budge and are ready to double Maguire's wages to around ¬£100,000-a-week to keep him at the club and bring him into line with their top earners Jamie Vardy and Kasper Schmeichel. Mourinho will turn to Bayern Munich's Jerome Boateng instead if they fail to prise Maguire away. Maguire's stock has skyrocketed since his ¬£17m switch from Hull just 12 months ago.

However Leicester's mega-rich Thai owners pride themselves on standing their ground and have previously shown they're prepared to play hardball with a Manchester giant. Manchester City tried flexing their financial muscles in their bid to land Riyad Mahrez but were told where to go by Leicester. City eventually got their man but it was three transfer windows later and only when they had stumped up ¬£60m to land Mahrez this summer. That represented almost total profit for the Midlands club who only paid ¬£400,000 for the man who went on to be PFA Player of the Year in the shock title win two seasons ago. Maguire could even be at Old Trafford for the season opener on Friday night ‚Äì but in a Leicester shirt.

746,Manchester United stunned as Leicester City demand ¬£75m for Harry Maguire,"Manchester United have cooled their interest in Leicester City star Harry Maguire after the Foxes demanded a record-equalling fee for the defender, Metro.co.uk understands. Jose Mourinho is intent on signing a centre-back this summer and the club have turned their attention to Maguire in the last fortnight after being put off by Spurs' ¬£75million valuation of Toby Alderweireld. Maguire joined Leicester last summer in a deal that could rise to as much as ¬£17m but his reputation was enhanced by an impressive World Cup campaign with England, featuring in all seven of the Three Lions' matches. United initiated talks with Leicester this week over a deal to sign Maguire but were stunned when the Foxes demanded in excess of ¬£75m for the England international Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is a notoriously tough negotiator and wanted around ¬£90m from Manchester City for Riyad Mahrez in January. The Foxes believe they're now in a similar situation with just a fortnight left of the transfer window and believe only a fee matching the ¬£75m Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk would be acceptable. That deal made Van Dijk the most expensive defender in history and Metro.co.uk understands United are unwilling to stretch that far for Maguire. United had been willing to structure a deal that could rise to as much as ¬£55m, with the club believing that took into account the defender's inflated price from his performances at the World Cup. Maguire, for his part, is keen on moving to Old Trafford and is said to be quietly optimistic that he'll be a Manchester United player by the time the transfer window closes. However, it's likely to take a significant reduction in Leicester's valuation of the defender, while Maguire may need to hand in a transfer request. But Leicester feel under little pressure to sell given Maguire has four years to run on his deal and the club know there's a short amount of time left to find a replacement. Mourinho has appeared far from pleased on United's pre-season tour of the United States and much of his downbeat demeanour is down to his frustration with the club's board. United signed Fred and Diogo Dalot to strengthen their first-team squad early into the transfer window but have failed to build on those signings.

The Belgian has made little secret of the fact he wants to leave Spurs , but there has been frustration at the United end about their Premier League rival's unwillingness to do a deal. That had seen them having to cast their search further afield, and one option was Barcelona's young prospect Mina.

752,Man Utd transfer news: Jose Mourinho urged to snub Harry Maguire and complete one key deal,"That's according to Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand. Mourinho has grown frustrated at a lack of transfer activity and is desperate for a new centre-back before tomorrow's transfer deadline. United have been linked with several high-profile defenders this summer, including Barcelona pair Samuel Umtiti and Yerry Mina, as well as Raphael Varane and Jerome Boateng. Mourinho's two primary targets are Maguire and Alderweireld although United are wary about overpaying. Maguire enjoyed a stunning World Cup with England but Leicester have slapped an ¬£80m price tag on the 25-year-old while Spurs want ¬£60m for Alderweireld. United need to move quickly to land their targets before the deadline or risk starting the Premier League season light in defence. And Ferdinand has urged Mourinho to swoop for Alderweireld, insisting the Belgian is a better fit. ""Harry Maguire did great at the World Cup,"" he told the Mirror . ""But of the players potentially available he would not be my first choice. ""I would go for Alderweireld, all day long, because he is suited to the way United play. ""But it will take more than a quality defender to galvanise them."" United have made three signings so far this summer in the form of Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant. Mourinho is keen to bolster his defence and has also been linked with a late swoop for Barcelona star Jordi Alba.

The Foxes will demand top dollar for Maguire, with a fee of ¬£65m mooted by The Times. And as the clock ticks down to tomorrow's 5pm transfer deadline for incoming signings, the Midlands side have moved to draft in two star players to cover for the potential sale of their prized asset. Maguire only joined from Hull last summer in a deal worth ¬£17m and they could now be about to turn a major profit. Leicester have already sold Riyad Mahrez for ¬£60m to defending champions Manchester City and could take their sales for the summer to over ¬£100m by cashing in on the Three Lions star. The Times say deals for Caglar Soyuncu, the Freiburg defender who was wanted by Arsenal, and Dynamo Zagreb's Filip Benkovic have both been agreed for a total amount of ¬£33.5m. They add the transfer double deal will still go through even if Leicester don't sell Maguire, with boss Claude Puel keen to add strength and depth to his options at centre-back. The Foxes have signed Jonny Evans from West Brom for ¬£3.5m and also have Yohan Benalouane and Wes Morgan on the books. Benkovic, 21, has undergone a medical ahead of a ¬£13.5m move. Soyuncu will earn ¬£50,000-a-week at the King Power Stadium. The 22-year-old has 15 Turkey caps to his name. But despite the two arrivals, Foxes boss Paul is desperate to keep Maguire. ""For me it's good for Leicester to keep a valuable player, and it's important to show good ambition for the next season,"" Puel told Sky Sports News. ""I can understand some speculation about our player because he has good attributes, but I am happy to keep him and hopefully start a great season.

The Colombia international was closing in on a move to Old Trafford after he agreed a five-year contract with United . But The Sun on Sunday report that United have now cancelled the deal due to a row over agent's fees. The report claims that United are angry with Mina's representative as he attempted to change the terms of the transfer in the closing stages of negotiations. It's reported that Mina's agent was unwilling to lower the fees United were due to pay him and Mina. And now United pulled out of the deal after they set a deadline on Saturday for the deal to be concluded but it was missed. Meanwhile, Barcelona's vice-president Jordi Mestre has also admitted that Mina's future will be decided by Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde. Asked if United are interested in Mina, Mestre told ESPN : 'It's top secret. 'We have to be very careful because Yerry Mina arrived last season and he's very young, but we will see. We will see.

The last of those six appearances was the shock 5-4 defeat by Levante that cost champions Barcelona the chance to complete the La Liga season unbeaten.

Manchester United, meanwhile, have made three signings but Mourinho, who gave a curt and blunt press conference today, wants more. The 55-year-old admitted he still wants two more deals but was unsure whether he will land his chief targets.

The Colombia international, who impressed as his country reached the World Cup knockout stages, only moved to the Nou Camp from Palmeiras back in January. However, a parting of the ways could be on the cards. Mina failed to earn the trust of Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde and, consequently, the Catalan giants are ready to cut him loose. Everton and Lyon are also in the mix for Mina's signature. But United are ready to enter the bidding, RMC Sport claim, and could conclude a deal in the coming days. Speaking recently, Mina admitted he was eager to fight for his Barcelona future. ""My family and I have thought about it and analysed it calmly, always thinking about the present,"" he explained. ""At the moment I am enjoying my time off, though. I am completely relaxed and God will guide my life. ""I have offers [to leave] but I want to succeed at Barcelona.""

While a top-quality central defender has remained a priority, United have struggled to deliver in the market. With the transfer window shutting in nine days' time, the club need to act fast on Mourinho's wishes. Everton have been keen on 23-year-old Mina, but Manchester United could now swoop having opened talks with Barcelona. According to Yahoo Sport, the Red Devils may land Mina for a fee of ¬£40m. While that figure is still fairly high for a player not in Barcelona's first XI, he represents a cheaper signing to his alternatives. Leicester have held firm over England star Harry Maguire, demanding ¬£75m for the 24-year-old. Neither have a wealth of experience at the top level, but Mourinho would apparently prefer Mina of the two. Elsewhere, Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld and Bayern Munich's Jerome Boateng are available. However, Yahoo Sport add United have balked at Spurs' asking price and there are concerns over the injury records of both 29-year-olds.

762,Barcelona Transfer News: Yerry Mina Exit Talks Reportedly Collapse,"Manchester United have reportedly backed out of negotiations for Barcelona defender Yerry Mina, and with Everton also no longer interested in his services, the Colombian's immediate future is now in flux. According to Goal's Ignasi Oliva Gispert , Mina was allowed to seek a move away from the club this summer, but a transfer now seems unlikely. Most of the links have been to the Premier League and its transfer window will shut early this year, on August 9. Mina's future has been a hot topic for weeks, as the Spanish press were convinced the Colombian was on the verge of joining a Premier League club for a major fee. The British press joined in the fun, and earlier this week, Sky reported he was United's top target: Sky sources: Manchester United cool interest in Leicester defender Harry Maguire and make Barcelona's Yerry Mina their top target. #SSN https://t.co/EzPoqXxYx7 There were many who frowned at those reports, as Mina only made the switch to Barcelona in January and didn't make much of a contribution for the Catalans. Football writer Sam Piler doubted whether he was of the required level for the Red Devils: Extremely doubtful that Yerry Mina is an upgrade on Smalling, Jones, Rojo and Lindelof for #MUFC. The other clubs to have enquiried about Mina are Southampton, Everton and Wolves, which is probably more his level. Much of the speculation was driven by his great showing during the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he was an integral part of the Colombian team. It was a reminder of the 23-year-old's impressive potential and should have made the Blaugrana reconsider their desire to sell him on already. While he's a raw player who thrives mostly on his tools, those physical tools are impressive. Mina has all of the athleticism one could ask for in a centre-back, and he's a threat in the air as well. His vision and positioning need work but that was known when the Spaniards splashed the cash on him earlier this year. This latest development could be a blessing in disguise, as Barcelona may now be forced to look at other homes for the defender. Rather than making a permanent switch to United or Everton, a loan deal could become an option. RMC (h/t Sport ) previously reported Lyon rejected a loan move for Marlon because they wanted Mina instead‚Äïperhaps the French side will revive their interest in Mina after the Premier League transfer deadline. A loan move could help Mina with his development before returning to the Camp Nou as a more complete player, ready to contribute for the La Liga giants.",TRUE

Jose Mourinho has been interested in signing Alderweireld from Tottenham since last summer and the 29-year-old is ready to reject all other clubs in order to join the Red Devils. Alderweireld was initially valued at ¬£75million by Spurs but the north London club have lowered their asking price to ¬£60m for the centre-back. The Belgium international is tied into a contract until next June and Tottenham have the option to extend it by another year ‚Äì but triggering this clause could see the centre-back leave for just ¬£25m during a two-week period at the end of next summer. According to The Times , Alderweireld's agent is on standby in case United make a last-ditch offer to sign his client before the transfer window closes. Stijn Francis is currently in Denmark but is ready to fly to England to wrap up a deal should United come calling. Harry Maguire, Yerry Mina and Jerome Boateng are also on United's radar but Alderweireld remains Mourinho's number one target in defence. Mourinho warned that United could be set for a 'difficult season' if they fail to make any further signings. 'My CEO knows what I want and I still have a few days to wait and see what happens,' he said following the side's pre-season defeat to Bayern Munich. 'The other clubs who compete with us are really strong and already have fantastic teams. Or they are investing massively like Liverpool, who are buying everything and everybody.

Manchester United are unwilling to pay over the odds for a 29-year-old who will be available for ¬£25m next summer when Tottenham have been quoting them upwards of ¬£60m. United have also approached Leicester for a deal for Harry Maguire and Bayern Munich for Jerome Boateng, while Yerry Mina was another option. But time is running out for Ed Woodward to complete a transfer and keep Mourinho happy. The Portuguese is convinced he needs another centre-back to challenge Manchester City despite spending ¬£30m on Eric Bailly and ¬£31m on Victor Lindelof in his first two summers. He also wants a winger but appears to have given up on that pursuit despite links to Ivan Perisic and, earlier this summer, Willian and Gareth Bale. The deal for Alderweireld now depends on Tottenham securing a replacement before sanctioning the move. And United are said to be doubtful of Tottenham's ability to do a deal in time. Tottenham are yet to spend a penny this summer and Mauricio Pochettino is set to go with the same squad as last season. United have been restricted to three signings in Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant. He has cut a frustrated figure during the pre-season campaign and is on collision course with CEO Woodward. Mourinho warned at the weekend that United would face ""a difficult season"" if he did not land a new defender, but that is looking more and more likely as the deadline approaches. That is bound to increase the tension between Mourinho and United's hierarchy ahead of tomorrow's Premier League opener against Leicester at Old Trafford. Alderweireld and Maguire are both believed to be keen on sealing a move but Mourinho this morning has claimed he is not confident of making any more signings. ""Signings? The information I have is no."" he said. ""I'm not confident, I'm not confident as the market closes today so it is time at least for me to stop thinking about the market because the market will be closed. ""So will have to focus on the players I have and in relation to this first couple of matches, maybe three matches because after Spurs there is national team and a couple of weeks to recover people and prepare people better, is to focus on players available so I'm not thinking about that unavailable list I give you, I focus on what we have.""",FALSE
765,Manchester United Reportedly Close in on ¬£60M Toby Alderweireld Transfer,"Manchester United are reportedly poised to complete the signing of Tottenham Hotspur defender Toby Alderweireld as early as Monday. According to Simon Mullock of the Sunday Mirror , the Red Devils have struck a ¬£60 million deal with Spurs to sign the Belgium international, with United unwilling to meet the north London club's initial ¬£75 million valuation of the player. Mullock added that negotiations have advanced in the past 48 hours, though, with Alderweireld set to make the switch to United in the coming days. ""Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, aware that Alderweireld was prepared to run down his contract before leaving when he became available for a cut-price fee, has now accepted that it would be better business to allow the former Ajax , Atletico Madrid and Southampton favourite to leave now at an optimum price,"" Mullock said. It's added that signing a defender is the priority for manager Jose Mourinho before the transfer window closes on Thursday. Leicester City man Harry Maguire and Barcelona centre-back Yerry Mina were also named as possible targets. Alderweireld appears to be the favourite to move to Old Trafford, though, ending a successful three-year stay in north London. As football journalist Ryan Baldi noted, since arriving at United, Mourinho has spent a lot of money in an attempt to improve his centre-back options: Alderweireld for ¬£60m would make it ¬£120m spent on centre-backs in the last three years for United. Should be no excuse for seeing Smalling and Jones start a meaningful game together anymore Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof have both been brought in under the Portuguese, and while each player has shown promise at times, neither has established himself as a Premier League regular. Meanwhile, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling remain error prone, and Marcos Rojo is too unreliable to rely on in terms of fitness. So it makes sense for Mourinho to invest again in this area of the team this summer. Per Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News , the links between United and defenders have been plentiful this summer. Wrote in February #mufc wanted Alderweireld and they tried to do an early deal for ¬£55m in May. They've been linked with so many centre halves since but 'interest' in majority was non-existent. Was bound to drag out with Levy but Spurs' woeful window has helped United. Alderweireld is potentially the defensive linchpin the team needs. The Belgian is arguably the best defender in the division when he's at his best, able to mix it physically with the strongest forwards while being intelligent enough to cope with some of the quickest. The 29-year-old is also a fine technical player. A trademark of his time at Tottenham has been his excellent distribution from the base of the team, which WhoScored.com highlighted: Most accurate long balls per game (10+ apps) - Premier League 2017/18 outfielders: Toby Alderweireld - 9.1 Wesley Hoedt - 5.6 Jordan Henderson - 5.4 Alfie Mawson - 5.2 Granit Xhaka - 5.1 Some lead for Alderweireld... Full player profile -- https://t.co/cVc39SeLWi https://t.co/VPf0iLOcW2 If the deal does go through, it would make sense for all parties. Alderweireld fell down the pecking order at Tottenham last season behind Jan Vertonghen and Davinson Sanchez; getting that kind of money for a third-choice centre-back would be fine business by the north London club. For United, the deal does represent something of a gamble. Alderweireld has struggled with injuries in the past two campaigns and turns 30 in March. Still, he's an elite defender, has proved himself in the Premier League and is undoubtedly an upgrade on the Mourinho's existing options.",FALSE

769,Man Utd transfer news: Tottenham set Toby Alderweireld price and Belgium star WANTS move,"Manchester United want Tottenham defender Alderweireld to join them, despite pursuing Leicester and Barcelona powerhouses Harry Maguire and Yerry Mina. The Belgium international fell down the pecking order in north London last season and, although United have a variety of centre-backs at their disposal, Jose Mourinho wants more. Tottenham have so far complicated negotiations over a deal, with their strained relationship with Manchester United dating back to the Red Devils' controversial capture of Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. And the Daily Mail claim Spurs have slapped a ¬£55million price tag on the 29-year-old. United remain in the mix for Maguire despite Leicester's insistence he is not for sale. But Mourinho feels Alderweireld would be a far more significant signing despite his Tottenham troubles last term. The Daily Mail say Alderweireld is keen to join Manchester United as he senses it is his last chance for one big payday with an elite club. Yet as things stand, Tottenham are refusing to budge. United feel ¬£55m is too high a price for a player who, next year, can be signed for just ¬£25m. A clause in his contract means he will available on the cheap and United would then likely trigger it in a year's time. Meanwhile, former United coach Rene Meulensteen thinks Mourinho's determination to strengthen his defence is 'a little bit strange.' The Red Devils have options in Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof. And Meulensteen said: ""It's a little bit of a strange one. I can only think that he wants another centre-back that is very comfortable on the ball and can bring the ball out from the back. ""That is the only reason I can find.

However, Goal claim Alderweireld's Old Trafford switch will not be confirmed until Spurs have signed a replacement. Tottenham have until Thursday to find a new centre-back and United are prepared for the eventuality they could still miss out on Alderweireld. United explored other options in recent weeks and held talks with Barcelona over Yerry Mina and with Bayern Munich about Jerome Boateng. Alderweireld is keen to leave Tottenham and does not want to extend his contract. Tottenham have the option to trigger an extra year on Alderweireld's current deal, but that move would also activate a ¬£25m release clause. It would mean United could snap Alderweireld for a bargain price next summer, but Mourinho does not want to wait for the Belgian as he targets a Premier League trophy this season.

Maguire has been targeted but Leicester are demanding ¬£75m for the England international. However, the Foxes insist he is not for sale and the centre-back seems to have accepted the situation.

789,Tottenham transfer news: Jack Grealish will NOT force his way out of Aston Villa,"The 22-year-old midfield maestro is disappointed that Villa have slammed the door on a ¬£25m bid from Spurs. But he is not set to agitate for a deadline-day switch, with suggestions he is furious and disillusioned understood to be wide of the mark. Tottenham believe their bid for Grealish is fair value for the player and do not intend to test Villa's resolve by raising it significantly. They could now turn their attention to Bournemouth's Lewis Cook instead with Mauricio Pochettino yet to make a signing this summer. Grealish was under the impression he would be allowed to go before the club's new majority shareholders took control. But Villa's new executive chairman Nassef Sawiris, has personally intervened and declared he doesn't want to flog off the club's prize asset. That looks to have caught Spurs cold in their calculated waiting game to land the rising star. With Villa teetering towards administration just a few weeks ago, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was hoping to cash in on Villa's perilous state. But his reputation for driving a hard bargain appears to have backfired after Villa suddenly found themselves with wealthy new investors. Sawiris, a billionaire Egyptian tycoon, is refusing to be bullied even if it means upsetting his star player in the process. Grealish prides himself on being Villa through and through but the lure of a top club like Spurs offering Champions League football had understandable appeal. He's been at the club since he was nine and has just bought a new house in the area. A lifelong Villa fan, Grealish got a standing ovation from supporters when he was subbed seven minutes from the end of Monday night's 3-1 win at Hull. Boss Steve Bruce wants Grealish, who has two years left on his contract, to sign a new deal. But that now looks unlikely.",TRUE

He was in the starting line-up for Monday's 3-1 win at Hull and was given a standing ovation from Villa fans when he was substituted with seven minutes left - before they sang 'We want you to stay' at full-time. After the game, Bruce told Sky Sports : ""He is a wonderful talent. We will do our best to keep hold of him, but it is going to be difficult. ""We understand the human side. He will want to play in the Premier League, Europe, Champions League. ""The owner has made it clear that he wants him to stay. To be fair to Jack, he has got on with it.""

Mark Schwarzer did not think Villa would accept the ¬£25m bid but thought it would be a great move for Grealish. ""They are going to have to pay quite a bit more money for him, purely based on his raw ability but if anyone could turn him into a top, world-class player it would be Pochettino,"" the former Middlesbrough and Chelsea goalkeeper said.

791,Anthony Martial to stay at Manchester United after Jose Mourinho struggles to sign replacement,"Anthony Martial may stay at Manchester United after all as the club's attempts to sign a replacement have stalled. Martial has been linked with an exit from the club after being publicly reprimanded by United boss Jose Mourinho for not flying back to the team's pre-season tour in the United States following the birth of his child. According to the Mirror , however, the Frenchman may not leave as the Red Devils are not willing to sell him unless they find someone suitable to take his place. United see long-term targets Willian and Ivan Perisic as ideal replacements but have been struggling to reach a deal with the summer transfer window closing on Thursday evening. Martial returned to training at Carrington on Friday morning and has been included in the squad for the final pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich. The France international left the pre-season tour early last Thursday to fly back to Paris to attend the birth of his second son, Swan, and therefore missed the game against Liverpool. Mourinho criticised the 22-year-old for not coming back to help his teammates, and the forward also missed their next match against Real Madrid. Speaking on MUTV , the United boss said: 'He has the baby and after the baby is born ‚Äì beautiful baby, full of health, thank God ‚Äì he should be here and he's not here.' Martial responded on Twitter where he thanked the fans for their support and insisted that his family always comes first.

792,Anthony Martial Will Reportedly Stay at Manchester United Amid Exit Rumours,"Manchester United are reportedly poised to keep Anthony Martial at the club this summer as they're struggling to secure a replacement for the Frenchman. According to Richard Tanner of the Daily Mirror , while Martial is keen to leave Old Trafford this summer, the chances of him sticking around are increasing. ""With the summer transfer window closing on Thursday evening, United don't want to sell the Frenchman unless they can bring in a direct replacement‚Äîand moves to sign long-term targets Willian and Inter Milan 's Croatia World Cup 2018 hero Ivan Perisic have stalled,"" Tanner added. ""It's understood a swap deal with Chelsea for Willian was mooted."" United are said to have been against a swap deal given 22-year-old Martial is seven years Willian's junior. Meanwhile, the ¬£80 million valuation the Red Devils have placed on their No. 11 is said to be putting off clubs It means Martial looks likely to still be a United player when the transfer window closes on Thursday despite the simmering tensions between himself and manager Jose Mourinho. As Tanner noted, Mourinho is said to be unhappy with Martial after he failed to return to training on time following the birth of his second child. The manager is said to have fined the player two weeks wages, and Martial returned to training on Friday with United. According to Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News , the conduct of the player has been questionable: Completely understand Martial returning for the birth of his child and, as he said, family comes first. It doesn't change the fact he wants to leave #mufc or that his professionalism and attitude have been questionable, to say the least. Martial's standing in the squad is curious heading into the upcoming Premier League campaign, as he tumbled down the pecking order at United last term. After a bright beginning to the season, Martial's form suffered, and the arrival of Alexis Sanchez in January made minutes tougher to come by. In addition to the Chilean, Martial also has Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard for competition in the wide areas. It's a frustrating situation for those associated with United, as the France international has showcased in the past that he can thrive in the Premier League. In his debut campaign at United, he scored 11 goals and grabbed four assists, lighting up the top flight. Football writer Liam Canning said United face a dilemma as to whether Martial's natural talent offsets other factors: It's a shame that Anything Martial wants to leave. Everyone can see what a talent he is and what a player he can be. But if he's going to be a disruption and cause tension in the squad, would rather Manchester United sold him overseas. No one is bigger than the club. It's difficult to see things being much better for Martial on the field this season than they were last. Sanchez has shone from the left flank in pre-season and will surely feature there in the early weeks of the campaign; while Martial can be deployed in other areas of the field, from the left he's most effective. Still, United fans will be desperate to see more of the player that has torn up the Premier League in bursts. If Martial knuckles down and showcases that type of form, it would be impossible for Mourinho to leave him on the sidelines for long.",TRUE

Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld and Barcelona's Colombian World Cup star Yerry Mina are also targets ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline, just 24 hours before United's Premier League season begins against Leicester at Old Trafford. Maguire has emerged as United's prime target to bolster their backline having starred in England's run to the World Cup semi-finals. The 25-year-old played on the left side of the Three Lions defence as Gareth Southgate guided his team to the last four in Russia. And a move to United would represent the next step in a remarkable rise for Maguire, who was playing Championship football as recently in 2016. Former England boss Sam Allardyce recently discussed the prospect of Maguire heading to United to play under Mourinho. ""It depends what coach he gets next,"" said Allardyce, when asked about the prospective switch. ""If you get a good coach, they both take into consideration and stop this palaver about centre halves being good on the ball. ""You've got to be a very good defender if you're going to play for Manchester United. ""I remember speaking to Sir Alex Ferguson and Brian Kidd about this.

801,Manchester United transfer news latest: Jose Mourinho left with headache after Harry Maguire bid rejected,"J ose Mourinho is increasingly worried that Manchester United will not sign the central defender he has been demanding before the transfer window closes at 5pm on Thursday. According to sources, at least one bid, possibly as high as ¬£60 million, for Harry Maguire has been flatly rejected by Leicester City, who remain adamant they have no intention of selling the England international who has four more years on his contract. Maguire will not push for a move to United, even though Leicester are close to signing two new central defenders in Filip Benkovic, from Dynamo Zagreb, and Freiburg's Caglar Soyuncu ‚Äì who, at one point, was of interest to United also ‚Äì for combined fees of ¬£33.5 million. Jerome Boateng remains a possibility for United , given he has been put up for sale by Bayern Munich, although the Old Trafford club would prefer to arrange a loan with an option to buy. There are concerns about the 29-year-old's injury record and why Bayern, who have been asking for 50 million euros (¬£45 million), are prepared to sell the German international. Pick a Telegraph Fantasy Football team now for the chance to win a share of more than ¬£100,000 >> B oateng has not ruled out the move but it is believed he regards a loan as a sign that United are not committed to him. A s yet, United have not made an offer for Toby Alderweireld and sources insist that Tottenham Hotspur have not set a valuation for the 29-year-old, even though there has been an understanding that he is for sale. Due to the terms of his contract, the Belgium international will be available for ¬£25 million next summer. The fourth defender under consideration has been Yerry Mina. The Colombian international has been offered to United by Barcelona, who have been looking to cash in on the 23-year-old following his strong performances at the World Cup. M ina has been of interest to Everton and the French club Lyon but United have been put off by the associated costs of the deal ‚Äì escalating agent fees and so on ‚Äì even more than the ¬£30 million-plus fee being demanded by Barcelona. Despite Mourinho's insistence that United need a new centre-half and, in particular, one who is comfortable in possession and wants to bring the ball forward, the club are adamant they will only buy if they can improve on their current squad. That could be a source of conflict with the manager. A complication for Mourinho is that United have invested heavily in the past two summers on players in that position: bringing in Eric Bailly for ¬£30 million from Villarreal and then, last year, Victor Lindelof for ¬£31 million from Benfica. I n addition, they still have the England pair of Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, plus Marcos Rojo, and while the Argentine international is up for sale ‚Äì and has also been offered to Everton for ¬£30 million ‚Äì he will be let go only if a replacement is signed . Even so, it appears Rojo is reluctant to leave. U nited are not ruling out a deadline-day signing but the noises coming out of Old Trafford last night suggested that was less likely and that the club were determined not to pay over the odds in desperation. This could place the hierarchy, and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, in particular, who oversees transfers, on a collision course with Mourinho who will give a press conference this morning ahead of United's first Premier League match of the new season, at home to Leicester City on Friday. M ourinho repeatedly warned on United's pre-season tour to the United States that they would have a difficult season unless they added at least one more player ‚Äì and hopefully two with a right-winger also wanted ‚Äì to the squad. The priority for him was a central defender and he will argue that he made it clear to United at the end of last season that he wanted his team strengthened in this area if they are to compete. U nited have spent ¬£67.5 million already this summer on midfielder Fred, the exciting full-back Diogo Dalot and reserve goalkeeper Lee Grant, and insist that they have no intention of selling Paul Pogba.

Christophe Henrotay The 26-year-old, who has previously said ""all options are open"" , is said to be valued at ¬£32m by Madrid but Courtois' agent Christophe Henrotay says Chelsea should show some compassion. ""I have been reading everywhere that Chelsea are saying it is up to Thibaut, but he has made it clear to the club that the best option for him is to move to Madrid,"" Henrotay said. ""For him this is a big decision because he wants to be near his family, and there is an offer in place for Chelsea to accept."" Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri admitted he was unsure of Courtois' future but the Italian is optimistic of retaining his services. ""At the moment Courtois is the goalkeeper of Chelsea,"" Sarri said, ahead of the club's Community Shield clash against Manchester City on Sunday. ""I don't know in the future. It depends on the club, it depends especially on him, but I hope Courtois will be our goalkeeper."" Henrotay also denied money is a motivating factor in Courtois' desire to seek a new challenge. ""We have seen suggestions that it is about money, and it is true he could get an increase with a move,"" he added. ""But he has turned down a better offer elsewhere because this is more than a financial decision. ""Throughout this it has important for everyone to be reasonable, and the buying club has come up with a reasonable offer for a player who has one year left on his contract when they know they could sign him without a fee in 12 months. ""Chelsea could get a fair fee for him now and sign a replacement. Or they would still have to sign a replacement next summer, but without getting a fee for Thibaut. ""It is understandable people might be upset because he wants to leave the club, we accept that. ""But this is a human decision based on someone wanting to be close to his children - and that is a reasonable thing too."" Courtois is due back for pre-season training on Monday, with Chelsea opening their Premier League campaign away against Huddersfield on Saturday.",TRUE
807,Real Madrid midfielder Mateo Kovacic rejects Manchester United move due to Jose Mourinho's playing style,"Mateo Kovacic has rejected the chance to join Manchester United after a ‚Ç¨60 million (¬£53m) offer was submitted to Real Madrid, according to reports in Spain. Jose Mourinho is keen on bolstering his squad ahead of the new season and is confident that United will sign at least one more player before the transfer window closes next Thursday . Kovacic, meanwhile, has already expressed his desire to leave Real Madrid this summer after failing to hold down a regular first-team place at the Santiago Bernabeu. 'When I don't play of course I'm not happy. I've enjoyed these three years in Madrid hugely, with incredible teammates, winning trophies,' the midfielder said last month. 'But I haven't been completely happy because my contribution to all of this has not been the biggest and it's something I want to change.' The Croatia international was signed in a ¬£22.5m deal from Inter three years ago but has only started 37 La Liga games since then. According to Marca , Mourinho is aware that Kovacic is keen on joining a new club this summer and United have submitted a bid to Madrid. But while Kovacic remains intent on leaving the Champions League holders, the midfielder does not want to join United, primarily due to the concerns he has over the team's playing style under Mourinho. United have sent an intermediary, Vlado Lemic, to help broker the deal with Madrid but Marca claim that Kovacic has major reservations about a move to Old Trafford. Madrid, meanwhile, are keen to keep the 24-year-old at the club. Kovacic is due to return to pre-season training with Madrid in the coming days after featuring for Croatia at the World Cup and Julen Lopetegui will attempt to convince the midfielder to stay at the Santiago Bernabeu for another season.",FALSE

But now according to Spanish paper Marca, Kovacic has gone AWOL and refused to turn up training. However, it is suggested he will stay in the Spanish capital until his future is sorted. The player has even met with the new coach, Julen Lopetegui, to discuss leaving the Bernabeu. ESPN pundit Steve Nicol last week backed a transfer for Kovacic to go through. He said: ""It depends on whether Jose Mourinho is going to try and change his style a little bit,"" Nicol told ESPN FC. ""I don't see how he can't; he can't expect to be at Manchester United for much longer if his teams continue to play the way they have done since he arrived. ""I think Kovacic would just give them a little extra something. ""Kovacic will work hard, there's no question about that. But he also has the ability and the flare going forward to create.

New Blues boss Maurizio Sarri had expected to speak to the Belgium international as rumours over his future with the Premier League club continue to swirl. Sarri said after the Community Shield defeat by Manchester City on Sunday that he wanted to see Courtois face to face after his agent said last week that he wanted to leave Chelsea and join Real Madrid . Courtois has regularly addressed his desire to return to Madrid, where he previously played for Atletico and where his two children live with his former partner. Speaking on Sunday, Sarri said: ""I have no reaction on the agent. I am not interested in the agent, I want to hear Courtois. If Courtois tomorrow (Monday) tells me the same, I have to speak with the club. ""I want only players with a high level of motivation. I don't have an answer for the agent.""

811,Paul Pogba agent Mino Raiola in England for Man United talks amid Barcelona interest,"PAUL POGBA'S agent Mino Raiola has travelled to Manchester United for talks over his unhappy client's future, according to reports. The 25-year-old World Cup winner has been linked with a move to Barcelona or former club Juventus this summer, with his relationship with Jose Mourinho causing the Frenchman to consider leaving . And, fresh from visiting his other client Zlatan Ibrahimovic , Raiola is now in England to discuss Pogba's future, report Mundo Deportivo . Barcelona are the favourites to land Pogba should the France international decide to leave United once again, with a view to seeing the midfielder link up with Lionel Messi and Philippe Coutinho in attack. Pogba was praised for his attacking displays for France at the World Cup, playing further forward than his normal role at Old Trafford. There is also a possibility of a return to the Old Lady, but Juventus' recent ¬£99million outlay for Cristiano Ronaldo has put the move in doubt. The French midfielder only rejoined United two years ago for a then-world record fee, after leaving for Juve in 2012. But Pogba clashed with Mourinho over his performances last season, and the Portuguese coach has already criticised him for throwing a party, instead of returning to training early . Following his World Cup success, the midfielder has been enjoying his holiday and is set to return to training this week. Yet, he will unlikely feature in United's Premier League opener against Leicester City on Friday. Should Pogba leave, United will want a deal thrashed out quickly to give themselves time to find a replacement before Thursday's transfer deadline.",FALSE
812,Paul Pogba Offer from Barcelona Reportedly Rejected by Manchester United,"Manchester United have reportedly turned down a transfer offer from Barcelona for midfielder Paul Pogba. According to Gianluca Di Marzio of Sky Sport Italia, the La Liga champions have offered ‚Ç¨50 million (¬£44.6 million) as well as Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes for Pogba. However, the Red Devils are said to have rejected the approach. ""Pogba is an important piece in [Jose] Mourinho's plans, and the club greatly value his marketing potential, so the Red Devils have refused the ask,"" said Di Marzio. ""Since the Premier League transfer window ends on August 9, United would not have sufficient time to find a replacement player."" According to Di Marzio, while Barcelona have strengthened their midfield already this summer with the signing of Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich, they are still said to be seeking to add another star name in this area of the team. It was reported by Jesus Burgos of Sport on Monday that Barcelona have a ""dream"" to reunite Pogba and Vidal in midfield, with the pair having previously thrived in tandem during their time together at Juventus. As this point the interest from Barcelona does appear to be a little ambitious. As for the offer the Catalan club are said to have lodged, journalist Sam Pilger is unsurprised it was rejected by United: Barcelona's bid for Paul Pogba of ‚Ç¨50 million plus Yerry Mina and Andre Gomes must have been done by the work experience boy for a laugh on his last day... Pogba became the most expensive player in the history of the game when he signed from United in 2016, and while he helped the team to the UEFA Europa League and the League Cup in his debut season, he hasn't been a huge success since coming back to Old Trafford for a second spell. As relayed by Burgos, there has been plenty of speculation that the relationship between Pogba and manager Jose Mourinho has been spiky at times. The coach left the France international on the bench for some important games for the Red Devils late last season. As noted by journalist Musa Okwonga, there have been some curious quotes from Mourinho about the player during the off-season too: 2/ Mourinho's comments are apparently bland but that's not the point - I don't think Pogba is helped by another media cycle about why he's not playing as well for his club. Silence from Mourinho might have been advisable here. But he just can't help himself. Still, most United fans will be desperate to see Pogba back in the famous red shirt after his stellar performances for France at the FIFA World Cup this summer. The midfielder was at the heart of the team's success, knitting together attacks with his inventiveness on the ball and helping transition play with his trademark surges through midfield. The man himself said he was out to prove some doubters wrong: Pogba silenced the haters üíØ https://t.co/wyCGO909N3 At United, we've only seen flickers of this talent, with Pogba often looking laboured on the field and in systems that don't cater for his ability. Pogba has shown for Juventus and France that in the right environment he can be a force to be reckoned with, and now Barcelona appear keen to shackle that talent too. The prospect of Pogba linking up with Vidal, Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho and Lionel Messi is exciting, but it'd be a huge shock if United sanctioned the sale of one of their most important players so late in the window.",FALSE
813,Man Utd transfer news: Barcelona make Paul Pogba swap deal offer - includes two players,"Barcelona are eager to follow up the captures of Arturo Vidal, Arthur Melo, Malcom and Clement Lenglet by adding Pogba to Ernesto Valverde's squad. And Italian transfer guru Gianluca Di Marzio claims the La Liga giants have made their move by proposing a players-plus-cash deal to Manchester United . Di Marzio says Barcelona were willing to sacrifice reported United target Yerry Mina and Nou Camp outcast Andre Gomes to get Pogba. While United would have been in line to receive a payment of ¬£45m (‚Ç¨50m) as part of the prospective agreement as well. Gianluca Di Marzio says United have knocked back the offer for Pogba, for whom they paid Juventus ¬£89m in 2016. United are said to have three reasons to have rejected Barcelona 's supposed bid for Pogba. United are unwilling to let go of a player with the 25-year-old's ability, as exhibited as France won the World Cup this summer. Pogba is also important for United from a commercial perspective as he is highly marketable. United would face not being able to replace Pogba either with just days of the transfer window to go. Premier League clubs have to wrap up all of their summer business by 5pm on Thursday. And finding a player to slot in for Pogba would improve incredibly tough with such time constraints. Barcelona new boy Vidal was asked about Pogba potentially joining him at the Nou Camp. However, the Chilean admitted he was in the dark about Barcelona pursuing the United midfielder, who's also been linked with Juventus. ""I do not know anything [about Pogba],"" said Vidal at his presentation. ""I'm happy for myself, I hope this is my year to win everything with Barca. ""I hope it's three Champions League titles in the three years I have a contract."" United might yet speak to Barcelona in an attempt to agree a separate deal for centre-back Mina. Jose Mourinho wants to bolster in the defensive department with Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld his prime target. But snapping up Mina may prove more feasible at this late stage due to Barcelona's openness to him leaving them. Mina was one of the defensive stars of the World Cup and scored in Colombia's defeat to England. Valverde has not fancied the 23-year-old since he joined Barcelona from Palmeiras in January though.",FALSE
814,Man Utd transfer news: Paul Pogba to Barcelona deal CAN happen - details laid bare,"Barcelona emerged as suitors of Pogba on Wednesday amid conflicting reports in Spain and Italy. Barca director Eric Abidal denied claims made by newspaper Tuttosport that he held a secret meeting with Pogba in Beverly Hills. But Barcelona-based newspaper Mundo Deportivo claim Abidal's denial left plenty of clues that Barca are interested in the player. And with less than a week before the Premier League transfer window closes, could Pogba be set for a sensational move to Spain? Mundo Deportivo have mapped out the details of a proposed move, dedicating today's front page to Pogba. Here, we look which factors could prove decisive in a deal being done this month. Barcelona have denied having a meeting with Man Utd star Paul Pogba #MUFC #FCB https://t.co/qc5V6WHj9M Transfer fee The report claims Manchester United may be open to selling Pogba - but only if Barcelona match the ¬£89m the Red Devils paid for him from Juventus in 2016. It is said that transfer fee shouldn't be a problem, because it had been set aside for Antoine Griezmann's arrival, only for the France striker to remain at Atletico Madrid. Jose Mourinho The understanding that Pogba and manager Jose Mourinho do not get on too well at Manchester United is a positive for Barcelona. The pair have endured a fractious relationship over their two years together at Old Trafford. That came to a head last season when Pogba was dropped for a number of games, as Mourinho questioned his star midfielder. Pogba flourished at the World Cup, helping France win the competition, and many believe it may be Mourinho who is struggling to get the best out of the player. Wages Pogba earns an estimated ¬£12m a season at Manchester United, roughly ¬£230,000 a week. Barcelona have a commitment to not spending more than 73 per cent of their revenues on player wages. This has led to tough contract negotiations in recent years, especially when it comes to paying their top stars such as Lionel Messi. This, Mundo Deportivo claim, could be a problem. Adrien Rabiot Barcelona remain keen on PSG midfielder Adrian Rabiot. However, the report claims a deal for Pogba is the favoured choice. Rabiot has been linked with a move away from PSG for years and talks between Barca and the Ligue 1 giants are supposedly underway. Transfer deadline Time is running out to get this season over the line. Manchester United would want to reinvest the cash earned by Pogba's sale to sign a new midfielder. And with a week of the transfer window remaining, that appears unlikely. Barcelona, whose transfer window in Spain shuts on August 31, will not want to be rushed into signing Pogba. Therefore, a deal for someone like Rabiot makes more sense this month. Pogba could be put on the back-burner until next summer. Investment Manchester United invested huge amounts of money into Pogba and his signing was as much a marketing ploy as it was football related. Pogba is one of the faces of the club and has huge brand appeal, just like Neymar at PSG and Philippe Coutinho at Barcelona. That is important to a club like Manchester United who earn millions from sponsorship deals around the world. Pogba appeals to a young demographic with money to spend and United would likely have to source a replacement with that same marketability to replace him.",FALSE
815,Chelsea ready to reject offers for Eden Hazard from Real Madrid and Barcelona,"C helsea are ready to reject approaches from Real Madrid and Barcelona for Eden Hazard and are confident they can hold on to their star man for at least another season. But the Blues may tell Thibaut Courtois than he can move back to Spain after the goalkeeper claimed he has proved that he is worth more than the ¬£200,000-a-week contract that was on offer. Hazard appeared to put his Stamford Bridge future in doubt by claiming, on the back of a superb World Cup, that the time might be right to move on. He also hinted that he wants to move to Real. There are serious doubts, however, over whether Real could match Chelsea's valuation of Hazard that stands over the ¬£200 million world record fee Paris Saint-Germain paid for Neymar. And with the transfer window shutting in just over three weeks, on August 9, Chelsea are adamant they do not want to sell Hazard and are planning for him to start the Premier League season with them. C helsea's stance will leave Hazard, who has two years remaining on his contract, with a decision to make over whether or not to push for a move himself or accept the club's decision. The Blues are willing to hand Hazard a new contract worth over ¬£300,000-a-week to stay at Stamford Bridge and talks between his representatives and the club are likely to take place over the course of the next week. While Real face a huge battle to try to sign Hazard, the Spanish club could have more success if they bid for Courtois who Chelsea would like to replace with Roma's Alisson Becker. Courtois is now in the final 12 months of his Chelsea deal and the last offer the club made to him was a ¬£200,000-a-week contract in December, which they believed at the time he would sign. But Courtois stalled over committing himself and is likely to find that his demand for a better offer to stay is ignored. Asked about his Chelsea future, Courtois said: ""I will go back and I will see what they want and how they say it. Obviously, with this World Cup, I think what was on the table is different than what I can have. ""In this World Cup, I have ignored all the speculation, all the rumours. But now, in the next few days, I will have a chat with my agent and see what Chelsea told him, and then we will talk. But I feel happy at Chelsea, it's not that I necessarily want to leave."" Courtois also raised the prospect of seeing out the final year of his current deal, which would mean he would be a free agent next summer, by saying: ""People always complain that players don't comply with their contracts, but maybe they do. ""I don't think they will keep someone with my qualities on the bench, even if I don't sign (a new contract). But maybe (staying) is possible, because I like it in London."" C helsea sacked Antonio Conte and replaced him with Maurizio Sarri while Courtois was at the World Cup, but the 26-year-old has hinted that he was tipped off over what would happen ahead of the tournament. He has also warned Chelsea fans that Sarri could struggle to get his squad ready in time for the start of the Premier League season on August 11. Courtois said: ""The decision (to sack Conte) was made a few days ago, but I think as a group we expected that to happen earlier because we heard what the board said to us already after the season and then it took until now. ""I don't think it's easy for a new manager to come in and shape us in a few weeks. I think fans need to understand we will need some time to adapt to the new manager and a different style."" Despite the fact he was already rated as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League, Courtois believes he proved his critics wrong in Russia and elevated himself to one of the best in the world - along with England's Jordan Pickford. ""I'm very happy with the team performance and I'm very happy with my own performance,"" said Courtois. ""I know this is my level, despite the people who called me a bad goalkeeper. I think I proved a lot of people wrong and I know this is my level. ""To call me the best in the world, I don't know. Jordan Pickford made some good saves against Sweden and Colombia, and Hugo Lloris made against us a very good save, and also against Uruguay. ""I don't think you can decide (who is the best) on the amount of saves, I think if you did, then I exceed everyone. But sometimes it's just that one save that does it. The keepers I mentioned, Subasic as well, maybe all four were on a high level.""",FALSE

Still, Andy West of BBC Sport is still unsure about the amount of money being shelled out on the Barca man: Looks like Yerry Mina is choosing Everton ahead of Man United. Fee around ¬£35m, which is a sum that only an English club would even consider paying for such an unproven player (four starts for Bar√ßa, including a 5-4 loss) no matter how much potential he might have. Crazy fee. Mina arrived at Barcelona in January, having established a reputation as one of the best defenders in Brazilian football in his time at Palmeiras. However, when he features for the Catalans during the second half of last season, he struggled. In the 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo and the 5-4 loss to Levante , the defender's weaknesses were exposed.

822,Manchester United Transfer News: Red Devils Reportedly Prepare Harry Maguire Bid,"Manchester United are reportedly set to make a bid for Leicester City centre-back Harry Maguire before the close of the Premier League transfer window on Thursday. The England international has emerged as manager Jose Mourinho's top target ahead of Tottenham Hotspur 's Toby Alderweireld and Barcelona's Yerry Mina, according to Sky Sports News . Kaveh Solhekol of Sky Sports said United know it will require a ""world-record bid for a defender for Leicester to be tempted to sell."" Maguire has risen to prominence courtesy of a strong season with the Foxes after joining from Hull City in June 2017. His performances earned him a place in England's 2018 FIFA World Cup squad. He played a key role in Russia and scored his first international goal in the 2-0 quarter-final win over Sweden. Maguire is a powerful, commanding centre-back who has emerged as one of the best defenders in the Premier League. However, he does lack top-level experience and has not played UEFA Champions League football. The Red Devils are not short of defensive options, but manager Jose Mourinho has not settled on a favoured central partnership. The club spent big on Victor Lindelof last summer, yet he has failed to become a regular in the team.

The 25-year-old centre-half was given extra time off to recover from playing for England in the 2018 World Cup. His performances in Russia - and for Leicester in the Premier League after signing from Hull City in a ¬£17m deal last summer - mean he has attracted interest from Jose Mourinho, who is believed to have made Maguire his top target ahead of the new season. Manchester United are preparing to make a bid for Maguire before the transfer window closes on Thursday , according to Sky sources.

Last week, Leicester manager Claude Puel made it clear he hopes to keep Maguire, saying: ""I think Harry is a very good player for us. It's important to keep him and just a few days before the season it would be not a good thing for the squad, for the confidence for Leicester. ""We lost Riyad Mahrez. We know the importance of this player. We cannot lose also a very good player for the team.""

According to Sky Sports , the Red Devils want to secure their man before the closure of the transfer window and are preparing a bid. It is thought that United bosses are aware that they will have to pay a new world-record fee for Maguire if they are to prize him away from Leicester. The current record is the ¬£75m Liverpool paid to sign Virgil van Dijk from Southampton earlier this year. Maguire only joined the Foxes last summer in an initial ¬£12m deal from Hull City. The centre-half played in all 38 their Premier League last season, winning the player of the year award which helped force his way into Gareth Southgate's squad for the World Cup. Sheffield-born Maguire started out his career for the team he supported as a boy, Sheffield United, before he moved to Hull. United have already splashed over ¬£70m in the transfer window on Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Fred, Diogo Dalot of Porto and Stoke City's Lee Grant. But with rumours of several defenders being shipped out of Old Trafford, a first-choice centre-half is high on Mourinho's wish-list. If United are unable to complete a deal for Maguire, Mourinho's list of alternatives is believed to include Toby Alderweireld and Yerry Mina.

Courtois was apparently AWOL from training at Cobham today, and it appears he will be granted his wish to move to the Spanish capital before Thursday's transfer deadline. It means Chelsea are in the market for a replacement with just days remaining ahead of their Premier League opener away to Huddersfield on Saturday.

Butland could be available for ¬£25million after Stoke's relegation to the Championship, ¬£10m less than Chelsea expect to receive for Courtois' move to Real.

The 18-year-old has been tracked by Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City in the past, having shone in the UEFA Youth League. According to Sky Sports , West Ham are now on the verge of snapping Felix up, with the playmaker regarded as one of Europe's hottest young talents. It is unclear how much the Hammers will pay Benfica, but there is said to be a willingness from both clubs to get the deal done. Felix is prepared to make the switch too, with all parties happy to complete the transfer. And talks are ongoing as West Ham finalise details over the Portuguese's arrival. Despite Felix's huge talent and potential, the competition for a place at the London Stadium means he is likely to head into the Under-23s side to begin with. Pellegrini has the likes of Marko Arnautovic, Anderson, Yarmolenko, Michail Antonio, Wilshere and Robert Snodgrass to choose from in his attack. Sead Haksabanovic, 19, is poised to join Malaga on loan as soon as today, while winger Nathan Holland may also look for game time elsewhere this year. Manuel Lanzini's long-term knee injury, though, means a space may yet open up for Felix. He is not likely to be West Ham's final summer recruit, however, with Arsenal's outcasted striker Lucas Perez close to signing for ¬£4m as back up to Javier Hernandez.

He has regularly impressed in the UEFA Youth League and has attracted interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. ESPN state that ‚ÄãManchester City , ‚ÄãArsenal and Paris Saint-Germain all hold a longstanding interest in Felix, which is indicative of the potential which he possesses. Felix is a versatile attacker who is comfortable in any area in the attacking third. Throughout his young career he has featured predominantly as a central attacking midfielder, but regularly saw himself utilised as a left winger as well. He is also comfortable on the right wing and even has experience as a striker. He began his career with Porto, but was released after the club deemed him to be too small. However, he has gone on to utilise his slight frame in order to beat opponents with his impressive dribbling skills. In Felix, West Ham would be getting a phenomenally talented youngster who has the potential to become a real star.

Talks between United and Spurs made little progress earlier in the window with the north London club demanding ¬£75m - a joint world-record fee for a defender - while their Premier League rivals would only stump up ¬£55m. Yet the Mirror say that a breakthrough has been made in negotiations between the two clubs and that United are confident of concluding a move inside the next 48 hours. The pressure is on with the transfer window shutting before the start of the Premier League season for the first time this year, meaning no incoming deals can be done after 5pm this coming Thursday. But United are apparently set to sign Alderweireld following a u-turn from Spurs chairman and renowned tough negotiator Daniel Levy. It is believed the Spurs chief has accepted it would be a better business decision to sell the 29-year-old this summer than risk losing him on a free next summer. Alderweireld has just one year left on his contract with the club and though he has an optional one-year extension, that would trigger a release clause of just ¬£25m in the final weeks of the 2019 summer window. As such, given Alderweireld's determination to leave following stalled contract talks and the form of Davinson Sanchez in his first season at Spurs alongside Jan Vertonghen - a deal is to be done in the coming days. The Mirror add that United had genuine interest in Leicester City's Harry Maguire and Yerry Mina of Barcelona as Spurs remained steadfast in their stance that Alderweireld would not go for less than ¬£75m. But he is now set to become United's fourth summer signing - after Fred, Diogo Dalot and back-up goalkeeper Lee Grant - for ¬£15m less than that.

Mourinho is wary of overpaying and reports have suggested United chiefs are looking at ways to reduce the fee. And according to ESPN , they're prepared to use either Chris Smalling or Marcos Rojo as a makeweight to tempt Tottenham into selling at a lower price. Both players have been linked with newly promoted Wolves in recent weeks but would likely prefer a move to the north London side. Mauricio Pochettino is yet to sign a player this window and with Alderweireld's contract expiring next summer, he may be prepared to accept any cash plus player deal in order to avoid losing the Belgian for free. Former United defender Rio Ferdinand has urged Mourinho to favour a move for Alderweireld over Maguire. ""Harry Maguire did great at the World Cup,"" he told the Mirror. ""But of the players potentially available he would not be my first choice. ""I would go for Alderweireld, all day long, because he is suited to the way United play. ""But it will take more than a quality defender to galvanise them."" Mourinho has grown frustrated at a lack of transfer activity and is keen to bring in at least one fresh face today. But he may also be considering a move for a midfielder if Barcelona continue their interest in Paul Pogba. The La Liga giants are believed to be keen on the France international and they have until the end of the month to finalise deals.

Harry Maguire/Toby Alderweireld/Jerome Boateng Manchester United's dogged pursuit of a top-class centre back is expected to end with the capture of one of this trio. Leicester's Harry Maguire has been a summer-long target for United, but his fine World Cup exploits with England have pushed up the Foxes' valuation of one of their top assets.

The forward is being chased by Chelsea, but Palace are unwillingly to part with one of their most influential players. A switch to Everton fell through earlier in the summer when Zaha decided he wanted to remain in London. The Mirror claim Zaha has set his sights on a switch to Stamford Bridge, and has already told his fellow Eagles of his intentions. Zaha informed the club he wants to leave, but Palace have replied only a massive offer will convince them to sell. The 25-year-old is now weighing up his options and could hand in a transfer request in an attempt to push through a move. Palace offered Zaha a new-and-improved contract of ¬£120,000 a week to stay at Selhurst. Zaha wants to remain in London and sees Chelsea as the perfect club to continue his resurgence. The Englishman's failed spell at Manchester United prompted a return to Palace, but Zaha was vital in his side's quest to avoid relegation last season.

847,Chelsea Reportedly Leading Race to Sign Wilfried Zaha in Latest Transfer Rumours,"Chelsea are reportedly leading the race to sign Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha , as they are willing to offer him a lucrative salary as part of any deal. Amitai Winehouse of MailOnline noted Zaha has been offered a new contract worth ¬£125,000 per week by the Eagles in a bid to secure his long-term future. However, Chelsea are said to be ready to put up ""considerably more."" According to James Nursey of the Daily Mirror , the Eagles star has rejected the offer of a contract extension at Selhurst Park and is said to be ready to make a big-money move elsewhere. ""He has already snubbed interest from Everton as he is reluctant to move north again, after a failed stint with Manchester United,"" Nursey wrote. ""He could even consider lodging an official transfer request after Palace told him they would only consider an irresistibly huge offer."" The report also noted Zaha has told some colleagues at Palace that he wants out this summer following interest from the Blues, Tottenham Hotspur and Everton. The speculation surrounding the Ivory Coast international is far from ideal for Palace on the brink of a new Premier League season, as there's no doubt he is their most important player. Still, as noted by bet365, the Palace star has appeared focused in pre-season: Despite months of speculation, Wilfred Zaha is still wearing Palace colours, scoring screamers and making assists. Unsettled: ‚ö™Ô∏è Wilfred Zaha üîò Defenders who have to play against him https://t.co/pOYFNmlfGE If it wasn't for his influence in the 2017-18 term, it's difficult to see how the Eagles would have stayed afloat in the top flight. After losing their first seven games of the campaign, Zaha's return from injury ignited Palace, as he assumed a talismanic role under manager Roy Hodgson. He scored nine goals, made three assists and terrified opposition defenders with his sensational dribbling. These figures sum up just how vital the 25-year-old was to the Palace cause, as they failed to earn a point without him in the side: Crystal Palace with and without Wilfried Zaha starting in the Premier League last season For more player stats -- https://t.co/gnmc4TYiHh https://t.co/EmGgfYX3wj Zaha has previously made the move to a more illustrious club, having joined Manchester United in 2013. However, he struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and eventually returned to Selhurst Park on a permanent basis in 2015. At Palace, he's benefitted from being the attacking star, as the Eagles focus their play towards his talents. At a team such as Chelsea, that wouldn't necessarily be the case with footballers like Eden Hazard in the XI. Daniel Harris of the Guardian thinks the switch would be a smart one for the Blues nonetheless: If Chelsea get Willian out and Zaha in for roughly the same money, they will be laaaauuuughing. The issue any potential suitors for Zaha have is the fact the Premier League season is just around the corner. While the Eagles have made some smart signings in Cheikhou Kouyate and Max Meyer this summer, you sense they will lean heavily on their No. 11 again this season. Chelsea will find it tough to get this one done as a result. Regardless of how much money they put on the table, Palace will find it impossible to find someone as dynamic, talented and connected to the club as Zaha at this point in the market.",FALSE

Pogba fell out with manager Jose Mourinho several times last season, with the pair arguing over his best position, while he was not happy with comments the Portuguese coach made about his World Cup displays either. His agent, Mino Raiola, presented an offer from Barca earlier this week which was rejected by United, and now The Sun report that he has told Ed Woodward it will take a massive new contract offer to convince him to stay.

He has signed a seven-year contract at the club and replaces Thibaut Courtois, who has joined Real Madrid. Kepa is second choice for Spain behind Manchester United's David de Gea. He has spent the past two seasons in Athletic's first team, making 53 La Liga appearances, and has one international cap. The fee Chelsea have paid surpasses the ¬£60m they spent on Spanish striker Alvaro Morata in July 2017. ""So many things attracted me to the club - all the titles the club has won, the other players, the city, the English Premier League,"" Kepa said. ""It's an accumulation of things, and I am very glad Chelsea has decided to trust me and to take me in as well."" In January, Kepa signed a new long-term contract with Athletic until 2025, amid interest from Real Madrid. He is the second key player to leave the club this year, after Manchester City signed French defender Aymeric Laporte for ¬£57m in January. ""Kepa is a very solid goalkeeper, who can become an even better goalkeeper in the years to come,"" European football writer Andy Brassell told BBC Radio 5 live. ""He was deemed good enough by the board and (former manager) Zinedine Zidane to be good enough for Real Madrid, but they wouldn't pay the clause."" Spanish football writer Andy West It's ironic that Arrizabalaga is heading to Chelsea to replace Real Madrid-bound Courtois, because just a few months ago he nearly simplified the goalkeeper merry-go-round by moving to the Bernabeu himself. In January, Real moved for Kepa by offering to pay his 20m euros buy-out clause with Athletic Bilbao, but he rejected that opportunity by signing a new seven-year contract with the Basque club. As often happens, though, that only succeeded in raising his value rather than securing his long-term future, and Kepa is now the world's most expensive goalkeeper. He joined Athletic at the age of nine. After advancing into the senior squad in 2012 his rise was steady rather than spectacular. Following loan spells with second-tier Ponferradina and Real Valladolid, he finally became a starter for Athletic early in the 2016-17 season, quickly establishing himself by showing impressive poise and maturity. Although Kepa conceded 43 goals in 30 league games last season, that was mainly due to the deficiencies of the weak team in front of him. A more accurate reflection of his talent was his elevation into the Spain squad, although his outing in a 5-0 friendly win over Costa Rica in November 2017 remains his only international appearance to date. His greatest assets are lightning-fast reflexes, allowing him to make stunning close-range stops, and calm composure in even the most frenetic of penalty areas. And although eyebrows have been raised by the huge fee for a player with just two seasons of top-flight experience, the consensus in Spain regards Kepa as the country's best young goalkeeper with a very bright future. Before Alisson moved from Roma to Liverpool in July, Gianluigi Buffon had spent 17 years as the most expensive goalkeeper in world football. The 40-year-old Italian, who this summer left Juventus to join Paris St-Germain, was purchased for 53m euros by Juve from Parma on 3 July 2001. While that record stood for 6,225 days, the fee paid for Alisson was surpassed within 20 days.",TRUE

The midfielder's agent Mino Raiola is desperately trying to engineer the World Cup winner's move to Barcelona this month. United have no intention of cashing in on their world record signing. So Pogba has taken matters into his own hands by sending a text message to the club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward stating his intentions to leave, reports the Daily Mail. Barcelona's transfer window shuts at the end of the month but United will have until 5pm on Thursday to land a replacement. It means the Red Devils face the prospect of keeping an unhappy player at the club until at least January. And Pogba has issued the club a stunning ultimatum if he is forced to stay by demanding a remarkable ¬£200,000-a-week payrise. It comes after the La Liga champions put a five-year deal on the table worth an incredible ¬£89.5m. He currently pockets around ¬£180k but wants a wage on parity with Alexis Sanchez and closer to what Barcelona are willing to offer. Raiola put the ball firmly in United's court when he said: ""I will never make declarations about Paul. ""You have to speak to Manchester United .""

According to the Daily Mail 's Chris Wheeler , Pogba has not only informed his team-mates and United's backroom staff that he wants to leave in the last 48 hours, he has also told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward via text message. The Red Devils are said to have firmly denied this and are adamant the Frenchman will not be sold this summer. Pogba is believed to have agreed terms with Barca on a five-year deal that would see him earn ¬£89.5 million in basic wages alone, which is almost double what he receives in salary at Old Trafford. His agent Mino Raiola would not be drawn on the speculation over the midfielder's future, though. "" I will never make declarations about Paul. You have to speak to Manchester United,"" he said on Tuesday. It's said Pogba does not enjoy playing under manager Jose Mourinho, with the pair's relationship growing increasingly fractious over the course of last season.

Manager who looks like he wants out vs player who wants out because of manager. In short, a mess #MUFC #FCB Football writers Tom McDermott and Dean Jones believe Barcelona could try to sign him in the future: Barcelona possibly playing the same game with Pogba, as they did with Coutinho. Public interest might be designed to unsettle player further in the hope of competing a deal further down the road. Might all depend on who the manager is at #MUFC in 12 months though. The interest from Barca in Pogba has been enough to leave United unsettled. If they don't embrace him this season, expect Barca to revisit with a more serious bid to take him away Indeed, despite Pogba's reported desire to leave Old Trafford this summer, it's difficult to fathom a scenario in which United let arguably their most valuable asset leave when they have little time to find a replacement. The Red Devils have until 5 p.m. BST on Thursday to complete their purchases for the summer. While they could still sell Pogba to Barcelona after that deadline, as the transfer window in Spain runs until the end of the month, it's likely they'll only part with players that are surplus to requirements. United have recruited Fred this summer after losing Michael Carrick to retirement, so in terms of sheer numbers, selling Pogba would leave them light on options ahead of a busy season. More importantly, unless a replacement of similar calibre can be brought in, the quality of their squad and their hopes of providing serious competition for their rivals would take a significant hit should Pogba be allowed to leave.",FALSE

It's unlikely to change their stance on Maguire, though. According to Sky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol, while United are big fans of the 25-year-old, they are wary of paying too much to sign him: Manchester United want Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng on loan deal. Determined not to pay over the odds in current market. Leicester saying Harry Maguire not for sale Maguire only arrived at Leicester a year ago and has enjoyed a remarkable rise. He's developed from a promising defender into one of the best in the Premier League and a star on the international stage. He shone for Gareth Southgate's England side as they made their way to the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. While Maguire is not one to shirk physical battles, he has many other attributes in his game. He's quick across the ground and excellent in possession too. The centre-back's charges from defence became a trademark for Leicester last term, and Maguire showed no shortage of confidence when he represented the Three Lions at the World Cup either.

As Samuel Luckhurst of the Manchester Evening News noted, while Maguire's stock is sky-high, the Germany star's reputation is diminishing: Irony is #mufc's interest in Harry Maguire was mainly triggered by his World Cup performances. Going off Boateng's form, he lost vs Mexico and was sent off vs Sweden. With that in mind, it's not a shock Maguire wants the move to Old Trafford, where he would be tasked with becoming the leader of United's defence. However, hesitancy about paying a lot of money to secure him is sensible because there are still flaws in his game that need to be addressed. Still, Leicester's stance makes sense.

The offer from chairman Daniel Levy is not one that is impossible for the two Villa owners to refuse, especially in a market in which attacking midfielders are going for upwards of ¬£50 million. Grealish played for Villa in their victory over Hull City in the club's first Championship game on Monday night and his manager Steve Bruce was not definitive afterwards on the player's future. Having emerged from their early summer crisis under the now minority owner Tony Xia, Villa are much more stable following emergency investment from the two owners. There is no certainty that ¬£25m will be enough and with Villa under no pressure to raise money, it will be intriguing to see how Levy responds. With Mauricio Pochettino having signed a new contract, and the new stadium due to host its first game in mid-September there are no new signings yet through the door at Spurs. Neither have they yet managed to agree a deal for the likes of Moussa Dembele, Toby Alderweireld, or Victor Wanyama, all of whom are available this summer.

Mourinho praised Pogba for his disciplined performances for France in Russia and wants him to play in the same way for United.

According to The Daily Mail , Pogba has made it known to United players and staff that he wants to be sold, just two years after rejoining the club from Juventus in a then world-record ¬£89 million deal. The 25-year-old is claimed to have sent a text to Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, of his desire to go. Sam Wallace in today's Telegraph has revealed that United have told Barcelona they have no interest in selling Pogba and are unimpressed that the player's agent, Mino Raiola, is trying to construct a deal in which the Frenchman could be acquired by Barca in return for around ¬£45m, plus Andre Gomes and Yerry Mina . Whether Pogba leaves or not - and it is exceedingly unlikely - there is no doubt he has become disillusioned with life under Mourinho. The Sun claims he has told United he wants a ¬£200k-a-week pay rise if he has to stay. Watch this space. Barcelona's offer of Mina as part of the Pogba deal is due to the fact Mourinho is desperate to strengthen his defence. United have been quoted enormous prices for the like of Jerome Boateng and Mina and have so far faced complete resistance from Leicester in the case of Harry Maguire , for whom Woodward is a great advocate. P ick a Telegraph Fantasy Football team now for the chance to win a share of more than ¬£100,000 >> A nd now it seems United will have to shelve their interest in Bayern Munich defender Boateng, too.

Pick a Telegraph Fantasy Football team now for the chance to win a share of more than ¬£100,000 >> However, there may be a slither of a silver lining for Mourinho - and it involves Maguire. The Mirror is reporting that Leicester's impending ¬£13.5m move for Dinamo Zagreb defender Filip Benkovic - and the fact a ¬£22.5m deal for Freiburg's Caglar Soyuncu is close - could mean new life is about to be breathed into the Maguire saga at the 11th hour. N ew West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has already spent big this summer on the likes of Felipe Anderson, Andriy Yarmolenko and Issa Diop but it seems the wallet remains open to even more recruits. According to Calciomercato , the Hammers have tabled an ¬£8.9m bid for Roma's French midfielder Maxime Gonalons . The Giallorossi have already rejected offers from Everton and Crystal Palace for the 29 year-old. W est Ham are also confident of completing the ¬£5m signing of striker Lucas Perez from Arsenal, reveals The London Evening Standard , as well as 32-year-old holding midfielder Carlos Sanchez from Fiorentina. As reported by Matt Law in today's Telegraph , Chelsea have agreed to pay a world record ¬£71.6m to replace Thibaut Courtois with Athletic Bilbao's goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga , enabling Courtois to move to Real Madrid. Spanish publication AS claims 23-year-old Kepa will fly to England this morning, having travelled to Madrid on Tuesday in preparation for his switch. The path of Courtois to Real will be further smoothed by the Liga club's willingness to send midfielder Mateo Kovacic on a season-long loan. However, if the Belgian thinks refusing to turn up to work to force a switch doesn't have consequences he is sadly mistaken, with The Daily Mail suggesting he will be hit with a ¬£200,000 fine. The financial penalty consists of two weeks' wages for the 26-year-old goalkeeper, who is thought to be on a ¬£100,000-per-week deal. A C Milan are in talks to sign Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko on loan, according to Sky Italia . Bakayoko moved to Stamford Bridge from Monaco last summer for ¬£40m and started 25 Premier League games in his first season in the Premier League.

Courtois has 12 months to run on his deal in west London and has intimated to the club that he will walk away for free next summer if he's not granted a move to the Bernabeu. However, the former Atletico Madrid stopper has refused to go public with his desire to join Real and is due to report back to training next week. Sarri is confident of keeping both Eden Hazard and Willian at the club but sounded less optimistic about Courtois and says the situation 'especially' depends on him. 'I don't know,' said Sarri, when asked if Courtois will stay. 'At the moment Courtois is the goalkeeper of the club, of Chelsea, and so I don't know in the future. It depends on the club.

The Premier League newcomers had yesterday agreed a fee with Manchester City for the highly-rated young midfielder. Wolves were expecting the 21-year-old to travel down for a medical this morning to complete the formalities of the transfer. But Zinchenko has had a change of heart overnight and decided to snub the chance to move to Molineux. The Ukrainian has been at the Etihad Stadium for two years since he was snapped up as a player of huge potential when Pep Guardiola arrived at the club. He was never expected to go straight into the first team picture, with the club happy for him to be given time to develop his game. Last year he spent a spell on loan in Holland with PSV Eindhoven, and then linked up with the City squad for their pre-season programme where he played a part. But Guardiola remains unconvinced he is at the standard needed to force his way into the first-team picture on a regular basis, so when Wolves came in with an offer they were happy to let him go. Now they will welcome him back to their group, although it is unlikely he will feature in the club's plans for the opening few weeks of the season.

It had been suggested that Grealish was 'disillusioned and disappointed' at not being able to move to White Hart Lane. But sources close to the player have told the Daily Star that's not the case, and that Grealish was upset at suggestions that he wasn't happy at Villa. The midfielder reported for training at Villa's training ground as normal today and is ready to try and achieve promotion with the club this season. If Villa miss out on promotion, he will be then allowed to leave next summer. Villa will offer a lucrative new deal that will see him more than double his current ¬£20,000-a-week wages. Grealish has been in constant close talks with boss Steve Bruce who has been acting like a father figure to him over Tottenham's moves to lure him away. Bruce is more than aware that Grealish was keen to move to Mauricio Pochettino's men with the lure of Champions League football and getting a massive stage to showcase his talents. The Villa boss has been sympathetic of Grealish's plight and the midfielder has promised to focus on the task of helping Villa win promotion after lengthy discussions yesterday. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy's hard-bargain waiting game looks to have blown up in his face. Spurs were hoping to land Grealish on the cheap as Villa were engulfed by a financial crisis which put them on the brink of administration, tabling an derisory initial offer of ¬£3m plus Josh Onomah. But as Levy held out, the Championship outfit were suddenly rescued by massive financial investment in the form of Egyptian tycoon Nassef Sawiris and American high roller Wes Edens. Sawiris immediately made it clear that he didn't want to sellthe club's prize asset at any price. Sources close to Grealish say he was disappointed after being given the impression that he would have to be sold off before as Villa's cash crisis engulfed the club. But he's always been completely split on walking away from the club where he is hero-worshipped and was always going to leave with a heavy heart. He is now expected to sign a bumper new four-year contract which could include a clause allowing him to leave next summer if Villa miss out on promotion for a second time. Grealish was one of the key players in a season which saw them miss-out in the Championship final at Wembley. Bruce is delighted he's got his main man on board for another season describing him as Villa's best player by ""a country distance."" The Villa boss, who enjoyed a trophy-laden playing career at Manchester United, has stressed all along to Grealish that he's totally aware of the situation he finds himself in and has tried his level best to advise him accordingly.

909,Jack Grealish set for Aston Villa pay rise after proposed Tottenham move fell through,"JACK GREALISH is set to TREBLE his wages after Aston Villa warded off interest from Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino saw his top summer target slip through his fingers yesterday as Tottenham left it way too late to get serious about signing the 22-year-old hero of the Holte End. The London giants never even made it as far as lodging an official bid for Grealish on deadline day once Villa made it clear during talks, Spurs' proposed ¬£25million 'best offer,' fell way short of their ¬£35million valuation of the talented midfielder. That left Grealish licking his wounds as he watched his dreams of Champions' League football and a return to the Premier League crash and burn on deadline day. However sources close to the starlet say he is now determined to get there with Villa. Wealthy new majority shareholders Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens now plan to compensate Grealish for taking the hit, by hiking his current ¬£17,000-a-week wages to the ¬£50,000 Spurs had set aside for him. Despite reports Grealish was 'devastated,' and intent on running down the final two years of his contract, the player trained as usual yesterday and will be in his usual place against Wigan tomorrow when he can be certain of a hero's welcome. Yet crisis-club Villa were at the mercy of Spurs earlier this summer as Villa owner Dr Tony Xia struggled to keep the club from sinking under a sea of debt. The Championship club was at its most vulnerable in July when a bill for ¬£11million was due and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy had an open goal at his mercy. But instead of pressing home his advantage with a realistic bid for Grealish, the cautious Tottenham powerbroker offered Xia ¬£3million ‚Äì plus Josh Onomah. Even Xia wasn't tempted to consider such a paltry offer for the jewel in Villa's crown and when the club's new Egyptian and American co-owners rode to the rescue with a sudden injection of capital, Spurs' chance rapidly disappeared. Strict Financial Fair Play rules meant Villa's new owners could not make the stellar signing they wanted to showcase their ambition for the club. But they realised they could earn the trust of fans by keeping Grealish to make a major statement about their ambition to return to the Premier League as swiftly as possible.

Dean Jones of Bleacher Report confirmed Courtois has not returned for training. ""The situation has echoes of Diego Costa going on strike to force a move to Atletico Madrid last season, as Courtois waits to find out whether he will be allowed to join Real Madrid,"" said Law. ""Real have bid ¬£35 million for Courtois and the Belgian's agent Christophe Henrotay last week called on the club to let him go."" It's added the Blues are keen to find a replacement before letting Courtois move on, with Jack Butland of Stoke City said to be the ""most likely"" acquisition at this point. Sevilla's Sergio Rico is also said to be a target. Alan Myers of Sky Sports reported the Blues have made Butland their priority after Everton refused to enter into negotiations for England star Jordan Pickford: Chelsea have made Jack Butland their top target if, as expected, Thibaut Courtois leaves for Real Madrid before Thursday's transfer deadline, Sky Sports News understand, after Everton refused to negotiate over a possible deal for Jordan Pickford. According to Law, it was expected Courtois would return to the Blues' Cobham training complex at 4 p.m. Monday along with Eden Hazard, Michy Batshuayi, N'Golo Kante, Olivier Giroud and Gary Cahill, who were all involved in the latter stages of the FIFA World Cup. However, it's noted Courtois has not showed, and Chelsea now appear to have a massive decision to make. Their star goalkeeper only has one year remaining on his contract at Stamford Bridge, and the Blues only have until 5 p.m. on Thursday to land his replacement. Kristof Terreur of Het Laatste Nieuws noted that this is not the first time Courtois has been involved in this type of scenario: Remember when Courtois went AWOL to force his move to ... Chelsea. Didn't turn up for a friendly game against Lyon and the fan day. A few hours later his move to Chelsea (with Atl√©tico loan) was a done deal. The situation is far from ideal for Chelsea and Sarri. The club has felt on hold for long spells in this off-season, with former boss Antonio Conte only dismissed late in the summer, giving the new man plenty of work to do on the training pitch and in terms of transfers. Courtois has been one of the most dependable members of the Chelsea side in recent years, so losing him would represent a significant blow. He's been wonderful for four years as a starter for the Blues, helping the team win two Premier League titles. Still, Sarri hinted after the Community Shield that if the goalkeeper wants to make a move, he will be sold: If Thibaut Courtois wants to leave Chelsea, Maurizio Sarri wants to know...

Alderweireld, who only made 13 Premier League starts last season, was valued at ¬£75million by Spurs and the north London club were refusing to lower their asking price for the 29-year-old defender. United had been put off a potential deal despite Alderweireld being reportedly desperate to play under Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, aware that Alderweireld was prepared to run down his contract before leaving for a cut-price fee, has now accepted that it would be better business to allow the ex-Southampton man to leave now at his highest value.

The deal, which has been greeted by widespread astonishment, will also shatter Chelsea's record that had stood at ¬£57m for striker Alvaro Morata, who joined from Real last summer.

Hazard wore the captain's armband, even when Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta were introduced late in the game and Sarri did not rule out the prospect of the forward becoming his full-time skipper.

935,Mateo Kovacic to undergo Chelsea medical today ahead of loan move from Real Madrid,"MATEO KOVACIC will undergo a medical at Chelsea today ahead of his loan move from Real Madrid. Chelsea have beaten Manchester United to secure the services of the Real ace who will spend the season at Stamford Bridge. Kovacic, 24, will arrive in London this morning ahead of his physical examination, and could even be announced as a Blues player by the end of the day. It comes with Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois moving in the opposite direction for a reported ¬£38million. While the two deals are not officially linked, it's understood Chelsea's agreement to sell Real Madrid the Belgian goalkeeper has smoothed the path to bringing Kovacic in the opposite direction. Boss Maurizio Sarri has targeted the Croatian international as he starts to overhaul the squad he inherited from Antone Conte. Chelsea face a busy two days before the transfer window closes as they look to wrap up the signing of Kovacic and world record goalkeeper Kepa from Athletic Bilbao. Kovacic will make the move to Stamford Bridge after telling Real he wanted to leave for the chance of regular first team football. He found his chances limited because of the form and fitness of Toni Kroos and Luka Modric - leaving him with little option but to look elsewhere even though Real boss Julen Lopetegui wanted him to stay. Lopetegui said: ""It is true that Mateo has expressed his desire to leave. ""I have expressed my desire to stay. If it comes out we'll see how we mould it."" Sarri targeted the midfielder after highlighting midfield as one area he needed to improve on his arrival at the club. He immediately splashed out ¬£57.4million to bring his Napoli player Jorginho to the club, and decided after the club's pre-season that he needed a further addition. Heading out of the club is likely to be Tiemoue Bakayoko, who is in talks over a a season long loan move to AC Milan. The French midfielder has failed to impress since his ¬£40m move from Monaco last season and was not even on the bench for the Community Shield defeat to Manchester City on Sunday.",TRUE
936,Chelsea transfer news: Mateo Kovacic having medical TODAY as Real Madrid loan deal agreed,"The 24-year-old has become frustrated with life at Real Madrid after starting just 37 games in La Liga in the past three seasons. Kovacic refused to train at Real this week in a desperate bid to force an exit - a request that has now been granted. Maurizio Sarri will play the Croatia international as part of a midfield three alongside Jorginho and N'Golo Kante. An announcement that a deal has been done is expected imminently, after Kovacic has carried out an interview with the club's official TV channel. He will be joined at Stamford Bridge by Kepa Arrizabalaga. The goalkeeper is on the verge of a world record move to Chelsea after his ¬£71million buy-out clause was met. Athletic Bilbao confirmed this afternoon the 23-year-old's release clause has been activated and his contract terminated, although there is no mention of Chelsea. The fee is a world record for a goalkeeper, surpassing the ¬£65m paid by Liverpool to Roma for Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker last month. The Blues have made Kepa their number one target to replace wantaway Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. A statement on Athletic's official website read: ""On Wednesday, August 8, 2018 at 1202 hours (CET), the Professional Football League confirmed to us that the player, Kepa Arrizabalaga, has met the requirements for the valid unilateral termination of the work contract that linked him to Athletic Club. ""The amount of the compensation established in the contract has been deposited. ""Athletic thanks the player for his contribution during the time he has remained in our club.""

Courtois spent three years on loan at Atletico Madrid from Chelsea, before becoming the Blues' number one in 2014-15. Real head coach Julen Lopetegui refused to comment on Courtois after his side's friendly win over Roma in New Jersey, insisting that Keylor Navas remains his number one.

There is a resolution that could potentially benefit all parties, though, and it has reportedly been tabled by Chelsea.

As reported by Mundo Deportivo (h/t Sport Witness ), Liverpool were once seen as a likely destination, but they have since addressed their needs by signing Alisson Becker.

946,Anthony Martial will not be forced to stay at Man Utd against his will,"J ose Mourinho will not fight to keep Anthony Martial at Manchester United against his wishes, but the forward will have to tell him that he wants to leave. United want Martial to stay and are ready to activate a clause in his contract that will extend it by 12 months, which would mean it expires in the summer of 2020. However, the United hierarchy - and in particular Mourinho - have been alarmed by briefings from the player's representatives that he still wants to quit Old Trafford after spending much of last season out of the starting XI. At boardroom level there is a desire to resist any attempt by Martial to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur , but Mourinho does not want an unhappy player in his squad and will demand to know what the 22-year-old's intentions are while the club are on tour in the USA. If Martial informs him, face-to-face, that he wants to leave before the close of the transfer window next month, the Portuguese will not stand in his way. H owever, that does not mean United are willing to let him sign for Spurs, even though he is a priority target for the London club. Spurs have been led to believe that Martial wants to join them. Instead, United would prefer to sell him to a club in Europe so that he does not strengthen a domestic rival. The ball is now in Martial's court and he will have to make a decision on how serious he is about wanting to move on. Even if the former Monaco player confirms he wants to quit the club, any suitors will have to make an attractive offer, with the bidding likely to start at ¬£55m for a player who was once rated one of European football's brightest prospects. There is no doubt that Martial has lost his way at United and a move could reignite his career. When asked after United's goalless draw with San Jose Earthquakes on Sunday whether he wanted to stay at the club, Martial merely smiled and walked away.",TRUE
947,Man Utd transfer news: Wantaway striker Anthony Martial set to stay for one major reason,"The Frenchman made it known earlier this summer, via his agent, that he wanted to leave Old Trafford having grown frustrated at the game-time on offer under Jose Mourinho. Martial - who has just one year left on his current contract although the Red Devils have the option to trigger a one-year extension - only started 18 of United's 38 Premier League games, completing 90 minutes on just five occasions. And in mid-June, the 22-year-old's agent Philippe Lamboley declared to French news outlet RMC Sport: ""After thinking about all the factors and possibilities, Anthony wants to leave Manchester United. ""I think that when United, the most powerful club in the world, do not find an agreement after eight months of negotiations then they do not really want to keep such an important player in their squad. That's why this decision has come - it's a well-thought-out decision."" And the likelihood of Martial leaving United soared after he left the club's pre-season tour of the United States to attend the birth of his second child in Paris and did not join back up with his team-mates - missing matches against AC Milan, Liverpool and Real Madrid. That saw Mourinho hit out at the youngster after a 4-1 loss to Liverpool in Michigan, declaring: ""Anthony Martial has the baby and after the baby is born - beautiful baby, full of health, thank God - he should be here and he is not here."" Yet Martial finally returned to United training yesterday at their Carrington headquarters ahead of their final warm-up clash on Sunday against Bayern Munich in Germany. But, Martial is now set to stay - because United want a direct replacement in order to allow him to leave. Their attempts to sign Willian from Chelsea and Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan are thought to have stalled while long-term target Gareth Bale is set to take over from Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. And as such, they are unlikely to sanction a switch despite Mourinho's willingness to allow wantaway players to leave. Despite United not wanting to sell Martial to a Premier League rival amid links to Chelsea and Tottenham, the Mirror say a swap deal with Willian was considered. United backed away from any potential deal due to the fact Willian turns 30 next week and has far less re-sale value than Martial. And now the player, who was fined two weeks' wages after his late return, looks set to stay despite having clashed horns with Mourinho - who is said to be unhappy with Martial's attitude. United value Martial at around ¬£80m, which has put off clubs outside of England with Bayern Munich having distanced themselves from a move for the former Monaco youngster. That fee represents double what they have paid for Martial so far, having paid an initial fee of ¬£36m with an extra ¬£8m in add-ons after he scored his 25th goal for the club. Further stipulations, such as winning the Ballon d'Or, could take his eventual fee to ¬£58m.",TRUE

But Mourinho's hopes were dashed after he was was told the Uruguayan international has agreed a new deal with Atletico. Godin's agent approached United this week while Atletico were playing in Cagliari, saying the player was keen to come to Old Trafford. Godin was heading into the final year of his contract at Atletico and United hoped to trigger the release clause in his contract, which is believed to be around ¬£18m. United were ready to pay Godin ¬£8m per year in salary and put together an offer for the agent to take to the Atletico Madrid board. However, within hours, Godin had signed a new contract on improved terms at Atletico Madrid earning him ¬£6.75m (‚Ç¨7.5m) net a year - something Atletico are yet to formally announce. Mourinho was keen on Godin but United believe the desire on the agent's part was always to leverage the situation to get a new contract. When asked about potential transfers at Thursday morning's press conference, Mourinho said he was ""not confident"" of bringing anyone in before the 5pm deadline . The Portuguese has made three signings this summer - Fred, Diogo Dalot and Lee Grant - but has so far been frustrated in his search for a centre-back. Sky Sports News understands the United boss had two bids for England defender Harry Maguire rejected by Leicester City, while Jerome Boateng - Mourinho's preferred option - looks set to remain with Bayern Munich after training with the German champions on Thursday morning. Godin has spent the majority of his career in Spain, joining Villarreal in 2007 before moving to Atletico Madrid three years later and becoming an integral player, winning six trophies including the La Liga title in 2015 and two Europa Leagues.

Their defence was tight on their title charge, conceding just 29 goals in 38 league games. Almost a quarter of those goals were spread out over just three games in which Mina was on the pitch‚Äîand he only made five league appearances in total."" Similarly, Ciaran Kelly of the Manchester Evening News was left wary by Barcelona's willingness to part company with the South American: Jerome Boateng considered as CB alternative by United earlier this summer. Like with Yerry Mina, a little concerning Bayern are so open to getting him off books. Interesting Mourinho answered question about him pre-match.

He originally had a ‚Ç¨100 million release fee inserted into his contract, but the Blaugrana have been content to settle for significantly less to end their association with the 23-year-old early.

He made just five appearances in La Liga, but he still showed enough potential to be heavily linked with Manchester United earlier in the summer transfer window. Everton moved quickly after United backed off, with Sport (h/t TalkSport.com's Michael Benson ) first reporting the Toffees had reached a deal.

960,Barcelona Transfer News: Ousmane Dembele Rules out Exit Amid Arsenal Rumours,"Barcelona winger and reported Arsenal target Ousmane Dembele ruled out a departure from the club this summer after speaking with fans via Twitch. Dembele appeared live on the Twitch stream of FM_Guru88, a Football Manager streamer, and was asked by fans whether he would be leaving the Camp Nou following the arrival of Malcom from Bordeaux, per Marca . The Frenchman was unequivocal in his response, however, and replied: ""I'm staying at Barcelona and I'm ready to play the Spanish Super Cup."" It's only been a year since the Blaugrana splurged ¬£97 million (plus add-ons) to sign the wing wizard from Borussia Dortmund, and writer Andrew Gaffney never bought into rumours he could leave so soon: @2FMikail @JaiP72 @Andy_1882_ @pokeefe1 @dacl1177 He was never going to leave. Bar√ßa expect great things from him this season and spent ‚Ç¨150m on the guy 12 months ago. Dembele was revered as one of the brightest youngsters in football upon arriving at the Camp Nou, but he was restricted to only 23 appearances in his maiden Barcelona campaign due to a hamstring injury. It was far from the whirlwind first season in Spain that his new employers were hoping for, but Dembele has the time and quality necessary to make a success out of his stay out of the club yet, said commentator Kevin Hatchard: Never say never in football, but I find it incomprehensible that Barca would sell Dembele after just one season. If the kid can sort his head out, he could be a genuine superstar. So talented. Feels like it'd be a huge error to let him leave so soon, so not totally convinced. Mundo Deportivo (h/t Mirror' s Martin Domin ) reported Manchester United were ready to compete for the 21-year-old's signature alongside fellow Premier League admirers Arsenal. In spite of their major expenditure to recruit the player from Germany last summer, Barca seeded some doubt in Dembele's place when they out-manoeuvred AS Roma to the signing of Malcom from Bordeaux in July. Sport (h/t Mirror 's Jake Polden ) reported at the time that Dembele had let Barca know he was displeased about them signing direct competition for the right flank, leading to intensified speculation over an exit. Manager Ernesto Valverde hasn't had optimal chances to squeeze the best out of his player so far in Catalonia, but the Barca boss recently indicated he was rooting for his prospect, per The Spanish Football Podcast : Valverde on Dembele: ""We hope this is his season. He can give us a lot, he's an extraordinary player. Even with the injury last season he gave us a lot. Should he be worried about Malcom? The important thing is that there is competition for places."" There's an outside chance Malcom also wasn't brought in as direct competition for the right side, said sportswriter Andy West: Bar√ßa's apparent lack of interest in recruiting a striker and the signing of Malcom makes me think Valverde is planning to use Dembele through the middle more often this season. Could be wrong but get that feeling. Arsenal won't feature in the UEFA Champions League this season and always seemed like an outsider in the hunt for Dembele, while recent chaos at Old Trafford means United isn't the attractive destination it once was. All it took for Dembele to end speculation was one sentence after hitching on the back of a Twitch stream, and all of a sudden the expectations for his season‚Äîboth at Barcelona and elsewhere‚Äîare completely altered.",TRUE
961,Manchester United Transfer News: Red Devils Reportedly in Talks with Kurt Zouma,"Manchester United are reportedly in negotiations with Chelsea over a move for Kurt Zouma as they search for defensive reinforcements before the close of the Premier League transfer window on Thursday. The Red Devils want the centre-back on a permanent deal, but the Blues do not want to strengthen a title rival, according to L'Equipe (h/t Sport Witness ). Everton are also said to be interested and would be willing to sign the 23-year-old on loan, per the report. United have been linked with Yerry Mina, Toby Alderweireld and Jerome Boateng. However, the club will only sign a defender if clubs and agents lower their demands, according to ESPN FC's Rob Dawson . Marca 's Chris Winterburn offered his view: If there is any truth in this, which I doubt, I can only imagine it would be a loan deal. Still personally believe Alderweireld will get over the line late on Thursday afternoon. https://t.co/6EdHDgdWtt Zouma joined Chelsea in 2014 from French side Saint-Etienne and is regarded as a highly-promising young defender. He has never managed to command a regular place in the Chelsea side, although his career was interrupted by a serious knee injury suffered in 2016. He agreed a new six-year deal with Chelsea last summer before joining Stoke City on loan. Zouma made 34 appearances for the Potters but could not prevent them being relegated from the Premier League. Matt Law at the Daily Telegraph said a move to Everton would be his best option: As reported by @sjstandardsport , Everton are interested in taking Kurt Zouma on loan from Chelsea. There has been other interest in him, but Everton currently his best option #cfc The Toffees have turned to Zouma after becoming frustrated in their attempts to sign Mina and Marco Rojo, according to Goal's Nizaar Kinsella .

The club have plenty of defenders with Eric Bailly, Victor Lindelof, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Rojo, but Mourinho is yet to settle on a regular centre-back pairing. While Zouma has plenty of potential, he still lacks top-level experience, and it's not obvious that he's a significant upgrade on the club's current options. Chelsea's decision to award him a long-term contract shows their faith in the 23-year-old, but he faces a battle for regular football at Stamford Bridge this season with David Luiz, Gary Cahill, Andreas Christensen, and Antonio Rudiger all in the squad.",TRUE
962,Barcelona Transfer News: Everton Reportedly Want Andre Gomes on Loan,"Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes has reportedly emerged as a transfer target for Everton . The Toffees are keen to bring him in on loan before the close of the Premier League transfer window on Thursday, according to the Liverpool Echo 's Phil Kirkbride . The Portuguese midfielder has fallen out of favour at the Camp Nou and looks to have little chance of first-team football next season under manager Ernesto Valverde. Everton boss Marco Silva wants to strengthen his midfield and a temporary deal is ""being discussed,"" per Kirkbride. Gomes joined Barcelona from Valencia in 2016 but has endured a tough time with the Spanish giants. His signing has been widely regarded as being a failure, and he was booed by his own supporters last season. The midfielder has said his time at the club has ""turned into a kind of hell,"" per Panenka magazine (h/t Lawrence Ostlere at The Independent). Barcelona have moved to strengthen their midfield this summer. They have brought in Arthur from Gremio and Arturo Vidal from Bayern Munich. The new signings mean Gomes has fallen even further down the pecking order at the Camp Nou. Gomes is expected to leave before Thursday's deadline. West Ham United and Valencia are also interested, according to Sport . A move away looks to be what is needed for Gomes to relaunch his career. The 25-year-old is an experienced international, who is excellent in possession and in need of a fresh start. Bleacher Report's Matt Jones said he'd be a great signing for Everton: Gomes was wonderful at Valencia, a midfielder able to dribble past opponents, find passes and play in different positions. If Everton could get him and get that player back, it'd be brilliant. Up the Barca castoff Toffees Everton have already brought in Lucas Digne from Barcelona this summer. The club are also being linked with a move for Yerry Mina, per Chris Bascombe at the Daily Telegraph . The Toffees have invested heavily this summer as Silva shapes his squad. Per the Press Association (h/t Standard Sport ), they spent ¬£40 million to bring in Richarlison from Watford as they bid to improve on last season's eighth-place finish. Barcelona would surely be happy to part ways with Gomes; while they may prefer a permanent deal, an initial loan may suit all parties. If the move does go through, Everton fans may have to wait to see Gomes in action. He suffered an injury during Barcelona's pre-season tour of the U.S. which could rule him out until September, per RAC1 (h/t Patricia Martinez at Sport ).",TRUE

Godin would have arguably been a better capture than any of that quartet. He may be 32, but he remains one of the best centre-backs in football. His immense experience and leadership qualities would have made him an ideal senior partner for United's centre-backs, all of whom are raw or inconsistent. But it always seemed unlikely Atleti manager Diego Simeone would countenance the idea of letting one of his most important players go, as Marca 's Chris Winterburn discussed: Atletico Madrid have no intention of letting Diego Godin go at this point. Has a strong partnership with both Savic and Gimenez. Simeone confident of challenging for both LaLiga and Champions League. Won't allow his squad to be weakened after disastrous 2017 summer. Per BBC Sport's Simon Stone, the former Villarreal man is set to sign a new contract with Atleti: Understand @ManUtd did inquire about Diego Godin earlier this week. Nothing doing. Is set to sign a new contract at Atletico. Godin has been a stalwart of Atleti's back line for the past eight seasons, and his influence at the club is huge.

""We have admired him for some time now, not only for his ability, but also his character and personality, which we feel will be an ideal fit in our dressing room."" The 26-year-old joined Liverpool in 2015, but made just 25 appearances for the club as his time at Anfield was marred by two serious injuries. Ings has been working his way back to fitness throughout the calendar year and made 11 first-team appearances for the Reds in 2018. Provided he can continue to avoid further injury, he'll be able to focus on rediscovering the form that earned him his move to Liverpool. Prior to signing for the Reds, Ings had scored 37 goals across his previous two seasons with Burnley , with 11 of those coming in the Premier League. Southampton will be hoping he can hit double figures this year. They averaged less than a goal per game in the Premier League last season and only narrowly avoided relegation by finishing 17th, so they'll welcome the added firepower. Overall, the move should suit all parties. With Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge in front of him in the pecking order at Anfield, Ings would likely have been afforded little time on the pitch regardless of his fitness. Liverpool have taken him off the books, and he has the chance to revitalise his career in a team where he might be able to play a significant role.",TRUE

Jose Mourinho brought Zouma to Stamford Bridge when he was in his second stint as Chelsea manager in 2014.

The move for Zouma comes after United were frustrated in their attempts to buy a world class centre-back this summer. Approaches for Toby Alderweireld and Harry Maguire failed as United were unwilling to meet their asking prices, while another target, Jerome Boateng, seems more likely to stay at Bayern Munich than leave Germany.

Talk has been rife of Dembele leaving Barcelona following the club's decision to sign Brazilian prodigy Malcom from Bordeaux.

When asked for his thoughts on the Blues' first game of the new season, Lawrenson said : ""I know the Terriers have strengthened their squad, but they are not going to come out and play open attacking football, and I think they probably already know they will be fighting to keep their head above the water again. ""This might be a good time for them to play Chelsea, who are in a mess at the moment. ""The Blues at least managed to replace goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who is on his way to Real Madrid, but they look short up front with Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud. ""For their sake, I hope it does not quickly turn into a season where, a few weeks in, Eden [Hazard] starts to wonder why he did not also leave for Real. ""It is going to take their new manager Maurizio Sarri a while to settle in and sort things out, which is why I don't think they will finish in the top four, but I am still backing them to win this game."" Courtois, meanwhile, revealed he would love to link up with Hazard again in the Spanish capital. He said: ""Eden is a wonderful player. ""I'd love to play alongside him again and we'll have to see what happens in the future. ""If he ends up here one day, that would be brilliant."" Sarri, who replace Antonio Conte over the summer, will take charge of his first competitive game for the Blues. His new club spent around ¬£130m on new recruits in the window just closed.",FALSE
992,Everton transfer news: Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes reveals reason for loan move,"As part of a trio of deals on deadline day, which could yet become a quartet if Kurt Zouma's loan move from Chelsea is approved by the FA today, Gomes completed a 12-month temporary switch. Gomes joins former Barcelona team-mates Lucas Digne and Yerry Mina, both signed permanently for a combined ¬£45m, at Goodison Park. The Toffees have paid around ‚Ç¨2.25million (¬£1.7m) in a loan fee to sign Portugal midfielder Gomes - who has previously been linked with Arsenal this summer. The 25-year-old fell out of favour at Barca and started just six La Liga matches last season after being an important squad player in his first year at the Nou Camp. But he will seemingly be a key figure on Merseyside having revealed that a chat with his compatriot Silva helped convince him to make the move. ""I'm delighted to sign for this fantastic club - it's a good day for me,"" said Gomes to Everton's in-house TV channel. ""Everton always was a big option for me, especially after speaking with the coach, Marco Silva. ""Every discussion we've had was very important in making me feel his confidence about my game. ""Everybody in Portugal knows how Marco Silva works and his abilities as a coach. ""For me, it was really good to speak to him because I know how good he is and I feel motivated to work with him and to play for Everton, a great club."" Gomes and Mina were joined by the free signing of Brazilian winger Bernard yesterday. Silva has also welcomed Richarlison, Digne and Arsenal youth goalkeeper Joao Virginia to the club.

Mislintat, in charge of Arsenal's transfers, has had ""continuous contract"" with Dembele according to L'Equipe, after finding out about the rumours which said Dembele would be loaned out by Barcelona - an option the player discarded when he heard it.

The Twitch chat was swamped with fans of the Dembele's, asking him whether he'd stay at Barcelona this summer and if it was ready for the match against Sevilla on Sunday. ""Yes, I'm going to stay - and I'm ready for the Spanish Super Cup match against Sevilla."" When asked specifically about Arsenal, one of the teams linked heavily with a move for him this summer, the player only laughed and dismissed the possibility of leaving Barcelona. Dembele didn't want to talk about potential incomings or outgoings at Bar√ßa, but he did admit that he'd love to play alongside Paul Pogba for his club as well as his country. For him, the biggest difference between Dortmund and Barcelona is ""the heat"" and the training sessions. Dembele was asked who he thought was the funniest person in the dressing room. ""He left. It was Aleix Vidal. After that it's Pique and Jordi Alba."" And the person he gets on with most is fellow Frenchman, Samuel Umtiti. When asked who were the three best footballers of all time, Dembele had no doubts: ""Messi, Zidane and Ronaldinho."" Specifically on his Argentine teammate, a person asked what was the craziest thing he'd seen Messi do in training. ""The nutmegs. He does them as if they are his job."" As for Messi on a personal level he said he was ""friendly, relaxed, but above all very good"". He said that Messi is the best player in the world and playing alongside him would only help him grow and develop faster. On the new signings he said Malcom was very good at Bordeaux and also speaks French. Dembele has already shared a dressing room with Lenglet for France. And on Arturo Vidal he said he had everything he expected. Riqui Puig and Miranda have been the two standout performers from the Bar√ßa B side this preseason and Dembele had kind words for them. ""Riqui is small but super strong. He's really good on the ball and he makes me laugh too. Miranda is very good."" Nothing is more important than playing. When asked about a preferred formation, the French winger said he didn't care if it was 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 as long as he was involved. Dembele was also asked about his diet and whether he could eat a good hamburger if he felt like it. ""Yes, every now and again, but we take a lot of pride in our diet and we're constantly being supervised.""",TRUE

The La Liga outfit hope the lure of Champions League football will be enough to bring the Belgian striker to the Mestalla, with minutes at the Blues not guaranteed, report the Daily Mirror . Despite the departure of Antonio Conte, 24-year-old Batshuayi appears likely to be once again spending the majority of the forthcoming season on the bench. Chelsea have been on the lookout for a new centre forward all summer, with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski their number one target . But Valencia are willing to offer a way out for the Belgium international, who impressed on loan at Borussia Dortmund last season. He scored seven times in 10 Bundesliga appearances, before injury ended his campaign early. Valencia secured Champions League football last year, after finishing fourth in the Spanish top-flight. They are hoping that the promise of big European nights will be enough to tempt Batshuayi to leave Chelsea and replicate his Dortmund form at Los Che. It would be upgrade for the Belgian, with the Blues only able to qualify for the Europa League, following a disappointing season. Batshuayi was limited to just three Premier League starts at Chelsea last year, having to play second fiddle to Alvaro Morata.

The ex-Saint-Etienne youth product was recently linked with a move to Manchester United. But Chelsea rejected their approach, citing they did not want to better a direct rival for the top spots in the Premier League, nor let Zouma leave on a permanent deal. Now Everton face a race against time to ensure the correct paperwork gets submitted and the deal goes through ahead of today's transfer deadline. Zouma has struggled with getting regular game-time since joining Chelsea in January 2014. The France international immediately went on loan to his former side Saint-Etienne, but faced competition for places at the Blues.

999,Chelsea news: Will former Blues star force Marcos Alonso move to Atletico Madrid?,"AS suggest that current Atletico left-back Filipe Luis - who endured a failed single season with the Blues in 2014-15 - is insistent on leaving for Paris Saint-Germain. The Spanish news outlet say that Luis met with manager Diego Simeone yesterday and declared his intention to leave for the Ligue 1 champions, who have reportedly submitted a ‚Ç¨5million bid. Atletico are said to want closer to ‚Ç¨30m although Luis is 33 and is into the final year of his contract with the Europa League winners. The experienced Brazilian is crucial to Simeone as his only out-and-out left-back in the Atletico squad, with his alternative Lucas Hernandez a natural centre-back although he played on the left for World Cup winners France in Russia. And if he were to force a departure to the French capital, with AS suggesting a move could very well be possible with the player's relationship with the Atletico boss having become strained, then the Spanish outfit may be forced to firm up their apparent interest in Alonso. Alonso scored the winning goal in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Arsenal last weekend and has been a crucial player for the Blues in both of the previous two seasons. The Spaniard was named in the Premier League Team of the Year last term having excelled in a left-wing back role with seven league goals and two assists in 33 matches. Alonso has moved to left-back in a flat back-four under new Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri but has retained his attacking threat with one goal and two assists in their first two top-flight matches of the campaign. And his form has seen him linked with a surprise return to Real Madrid, whose youth academy he progressed through earlier in his career, or a move to Atletico. It is claimed by AS that both clubs have kept tabs on the 27-year-old, with Real reportedly weighing up a move after sanctioning a loan move for Theo Hernandez - brother of Atletico defender Lucas - to Real Sociedad. It is unlikely Chelsea would be willing to sell such a key player like Alonso with the inability to recruit a replacement until January, with the summer transfer window for Premier League clubs having closed on the eve of the season this year. Emerson Palmieri is their only other left-back having joined from Roma for an initial ¬£17.5million back in January but the Brazilian made just seven appearances across all competitions after his Stamford Bridge arrival. Yet Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak has appeared to confirm Luis' wish to leave the Spanish capital - which could force Atletico's hand. He said: ""It's a little sad, but it is what it is. He has a good opportunity and you have to respect the decision of each player. Let's see what happens."" But positively for Chelsea, Simeone clearly has no intent to let the player leave. He said ahead of their clash with Valencia, which they drew 1-1: ""He's a player who we love much much, he is very important for us and for the team. ""I always want the very best for all of the players who have given their heart and soul for the club.""",FALSE
1000,Chelsea news: Marcos Alonso to Real Madrid transfer prediction made,"That's according to ESPN pundit Paul Mariner who says the Blues can't sanction his departure because Emerson Palmieri isn't a solid enough replacement. The Spanish transfer window is still open and Alonso has been linked with Real. But the former Fiorentina star has been an integral performer for Chelsea in recent years and bagged an assist against Arsenal on Saturday. Palmieri was signed from Roma in January. However, he's been a peripheral figure in west London and has made just seven appearances for the club. Mariner says he understands why Alonso might be keen on moving to the Bernabeu. The former Arsenal forward says Chelsea won't sanction his departure though. ""Look, he started his career at Real Madrid,"" Mariner said. ""I understand he may want to go back, I know all that sort of sob-story stuff. ""But, in (Maurizio) Sarri's system, I think he's in a perfect position. ""We saw him at the weekend, an assist and a goal, he likes to get forward. ""He has got quality with that left foot. Does he want to go as an understudy? Because that's what he'd be. ""He'd be an understudy, okay he'd be going back home, but I just can't see it. ""I don't think Emerson's ready to come in and fill that void if Alonso goes. ""So I'm going to say this is a miss."" Chelsea put three past the Gunners in their last match. Speaking after the clash, Maurizio Sarri said: ""In this period for us it's not easy to gain points. ""Three points is an important target for us. ""We did very well for 75 minutes but, inside that, 15 minutes were horrible. ""It was very, very difficult because we lost the distances between the players and we were unable to cover the lost balls and press like a team, so we were really in trouble.

1001,Chelsea considering shock sale of Marcos Alonso if Atletico Madrid meet ¬£54m asking price,"Chelsea are willing to sell defender Marcos Alonso to Atletico Madrid if the Spanish side meet their asking price even though they would be unable to sign a replacement, according to reports. Atletico are bracing themselves to lose left-back Filipe Luis, who is being chased by Paris Saint-Germain, and have identified Alonso as the perfect replacement. And according to Spanish publication Diario AS , Chelsea are considering letting Alonso leave if the Liga side make an offer in excess of their ¬£54million valuation. Although the west London club are extremely reluctant to lose the 27-year-old, that stance could change if they receive an offer that is too good to turn down. Maurizio Sarri has previously emphasised his status as a coach, rather than a manager, and would accept the decision to sell a player who has made an excellent start to the new season. Alonso is Chelsea's first-choice left-back and scored the winning goal against Arsenal last weekend, while he also created Pedro's opener. His ability to combine such effective attacking with solid defensive work has impressed Sarri in his short time in charge of the club ‚Äì as well as Diego Simeone. Sarri could still call upon Emerson should Alonso's departure be sanctioned, who joined the club from Roma in a ¬£22m deal in January, while Cesar Azpilicueta has played at left-back. Alonso was born in Madrid and came through Real's academy, though never made the first-team grade, and is thought to open to returning to his homeland.",FALSE
1002,Chelsea Will Reportedly 'Reject All Offers' for Marcos Alonso Amid Exit Rumours,"Chelsea will reportedly turn down ""all offers"" for Marcos Alonso this summer amid speculation he is wanted by both Real and Atletico Madrid . According to Sami Mokbel of the Daily Mail , the Blues have ""no interest"" in parting with the Spaniard, who is attracting interest from the Spanish capital, where the transfer window remains open until the end of the month. Javier G. Matallanas of Spanish outlet AS reported Alonso had emerged as a target for both Madrid clubs with a potential price tag of just ‚Ç¨30 million (¬£26.9 million). Alonso's career began at Real, but he made just one senior appearance for the club before spells with Bolton Wanderers, Sunderland and Fiorentina. The Spaniard was particularly impressive in Italy, earning his move to Stamford Bridge in 2016. Since then, he has repeatedly showcased his ability to contribute going forward, and he already has a goal and two assists in two Premier League appearances this season. After he grabbed one apiece in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Arsenal, sports lawyer and writer Jake Cohen praised his attacking prowess: Once laughably slated by some as a ""panic buy,"" Marcos Alonso once again solidifying his position as the best offensive-minded defender in the league. That's 20 goals and assists in just 66 Premier League matches (14G, 6A) What can let the 27-year-old down is his defensive capability, which has been shown to be somewhat suspect during his time with Chelsea. The Gunners ‚Äîparticularly Hector Bellerin ‚Äî repeatedly caused him problems in that clash, and it's hardly the first time he has been vulnerable. ESPN FC's Liam Twomey noted his struggles at the back, while colleague Mark Worrall hopes Blues boss Maurizio Sarri can help him improve in that regard: This game has perfectly encapsulated what makes Alonso so polarising. Defensively he's a problem in big games but he's such a big-game player #cfc #afc Alonso assists and scores, there has to be a place for him in this Chelsea team. Sarri simply needs to punch it into him how to defend as a full back. It's that simple. UTC Alonso isn't likely to transform into a top-class defender at this stage of his career, but with the right coaching he could at least become a more reliable presence at left-back. If not, the solution could be to deploy him further forward, limiting his defensive responsibility and maximising his attacking output. Either way, despite his flaws he has shown himself to be a valuable asset to Chelsea, so keeping him at Stamford Bridge could be a wise course of action, particularly at a stage when a replacement can't be brought in. If Real or Atletico do hope to test their resolve, they'll need to offer significantly more than the reported fee to have a realistic chance of prising him away.",TRUE
1003,Chelsea news: Blues ready to take tough stance over Marcos Alonso transfer,"Chelsea are hoping to keep hold of their main stars despite the Spanish transfer window being open until August 31. Reports have emerged suggesting Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are chasing a deal for the Spaniard to bolster their options at left-back. Real's only marquee signing to date this summer has been Thibaut Courtois, and further rebuilding is required to overhaul La Liga rivals Barcelona this season. But according to the Daily Mail, the Blues are ready to rebuff all offers for Alonso should they come in. The Mail say that there is no particular strong desire on the 27-year-old's part to leave Chelsea as he is settled. Should Alonso leave, the west London outfit would be unable to fill the void until January with the Premier League window closed. Alonso has been an integral figure for Chelsea and he scored the winner in his side's 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge last Saturday. Similarly, Real may look to make one final push to sign Eden Hazard before the end of the month. Los Blancos have been monitoring the Belgium international over the past few years and are yet to make a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, who swapped La Liga for Serie A when he joined Juventus earlier this summer. After Real's defeat to Atletico in the UEFA Super Cup, BT Sport pundit Owen Hargreaves suggested the club needed to make at least TWO signings. ""They need two attackers. Benzema scored a great goal and Bale looked terrific in little spells,"" he said. ""But what happens if one of them gets injured? ""Asensio is a terrific player, but he's still very young and for him to carry the load that Cristiano [Ronaldo] did is unfair. ""Mayoral is not proven - they need two stars, two difference makers.

1006,Why David de Gea is yet to sign new Manchester United contract,"Manchester United remain confident David de Gea will sign a new long-term contract despite the club's chaotic start to the new season, Metro.co.uk understands. Jose Mourinho's side narrowly beat Leicester a fortnight ago at Old Trafford amid a backdrop of speculation surrounding the future of Paul Pogba and a negative atmosphere generated by the manager's pessimistic prediction that United were in for a 'difficult season'. United were subsequently beaten at Brighton for the second time in four months last weekend, a defeat which sparked a wave of fresh criticism ahead of Monday's crunch match with Tottenham. Despite the negativity, Metro.co.uk understands De Gea is still keen to commit the peak years of his career to the club he joined seven years ago, although his representatives are pushing for him to be rewarded with a contract that befits his status as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. The Spain international's agents are angling for a deal worth ¬£350,000-a-week which would make the 27-year-old the club's highest earner, taking into account basic salary only. 'He likes it here, we love him, we want him to stay, he wants to stay, so when a player is not in the market the value is zero. 'A goalkeeper is a player and sometimes people forget that. A goalkeeper wins points and wins titles, so he is as important as another player.' Romelu Lukaku is the club's top earner in that regard on ¬£275,000-a-week, although Pogba and Alexis Sanchez both receive well in excess of that figure taking into account various bonuses and commercial tie-ins. Metro.co.uk revealed last week that Pogba was due a loyalty bonus of ¬£3.4m this month on the assumption he remains at United and fails to engineer a move to Barcelona before the August 31st transfer window deadline. De Gea's representatives are said to feel their client's value has increased as a result of the world record fees paid by Liverpool and then Chelsea for Alisson Becker and Kepa Arrizabalaga. Although there is no suggestion that De Gea would agitate for a move in the way that Thibaut Courtois did for force through his transfer to Real Madrid, his agents believe, were he on the market, he would command a fee in excess of the ¬£73m Chelsea paid to trigger Kepa's Athletic Bilbao release clause.",FALSE
1007,David de Gea unhappy with Manchester United contract offer,"David de Gea is unhappy with Manchester United 's latest contract offer and is holding out for a deal comparable with high earners Alexis Sanchez and Paul Pogba , according to reports. The Spaniard is out of contract next summer, though United can automatically trigger an additional year, and manager Jose Mourinho recently insisted that an announcement was imminent. However, the Daily Record report that talks have hit a fresh standstill and no agreement is close to being reached, with United's board unwilling to give in to De Gea's demands. The Spaniard, who has been the club's Player of the Year in four of the last five seasons, is widely regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world and wants a contract that reflects that. However, he is still waiting to receive a contract offer in that ballpark, with United CEO Ed Woodward reluctant to give a goalkeeper the same salary as Pogba and Sanchez. In fact, as revealed by Metro.co.uk , De Gea's ¬£350,000-a-week basic salary demand would make him by far the biggest earner at United. Pogba and Sanchez earn close to that amount only when bonuses and commercial tie-ins are added, but Romelu Lukaku takes home the highest basic salary on ¬£275,000-a-week. According to the Daily Record, United have been emboldened to play hardball after Real Madrid opted to sign Thibaut Courtois, but Paris Saint-Germain could try to prise De Gea away next summer. Speaking about De Gea's future earlier this month, Mourinho said: 'His valuation is zero, because he is a Manchester United player who, as soon as possible, will sign a new contract. 'He likes it here, we love him, we want him to stay, he wants to stay, so when a player is not in the market the value is zero.'",FALSE
1008,Report: David De Gea Wants Manchester United Contract Similar to Paul Pogba's,"David De Gea reportedly wants wages similar to Paul Pogba and Alexis Sanchez before he will extend his contract at Manchester United . According to Duncan Castles of the Daily Record , the Spain international goalkeeper is not ""close"" to agreeing a deal with the Red Devils. De Gea's contract expires next summer, but United have an option to extend for another year. According to Castles, De Gea believes his performances in recent seasons justify parity with United's top earners. Among those performances, Castles cited De Gea's player-of-the-year awards in four of the past five seasons while also regularly being recognised as the top goalkeeper in England by the PFA. De Gea is also said to be emboldened by the lavish transfer fees 'keepers have been commanding in this summer's transfer market. United's rivals Liverpool broke the record for the position when Alisson Becker arrived from AS Roma for ¬£67 million in July, and the benchmark was soon lifted when Chelsea secured the signing of Kepa Arrizabalaga for ¬£71 million in early August. De Gea wants ¬£350,000 per week to prolong his stay at Old Trafford, according to Metro 's James Goldman . Few would have a problem believing De Gea is worth such a wage, if not more, after his standout performances throughout his United career. The Spaniard has kept United in games during the past few years, making outstanding saves and standing firm in the face of pressure. A snapshot of De Gea's value to United was provided during a 3-1 win away to Arsenal in December, when the 27-year-old made 14 saves . Performances like this one helped United field the second-stingiest defence in the Premier League: Save percentage of Premier League top-six goalkeepers in 2017/18: üî¥ David de Gea (80.28%) ‚ö™Ô∏è Hugo Lloris (70.09%) üî¥ Loris Karius (68.89%) üîµ Thibaut Courtois (68.52%) üîµ Ederson (68.29%) üî¥ Petr Cech (64.44%) Golden Glove for a reason. https://t.co/eE6eXwarqR Yet for all his undoubted excellence, frailty has steadily crept into De Gea 's game recently: David De Gea: Last 14 shots on target faced in all competitions (club and country) ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è üëê ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è üëê üëê üëê ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è ‚öΩÔ∏è For more player stats -- https://t.co/TkuM4FT3wI https://t.co/seOBb2dzFQ The issues were apparent during the recent loss to Brighton & Hove Albion, when De Gea was beaten three times, including from the penalty spot.

The 27-year-old has been linked with a move back to his homeland for a number of years, with Real's quest to replace standout goalkeeper Iker Casillas having rumbled on since his departure from the club three years ago. With Real's pursuit of De Gea now seemingly over though following their ¬£38m acquisition of ‚ÄãChelsea goalkeeper Courtois, it appears the Red Devils want De Gea to reaffirm his commitment to the club - by signing a new long-term contract. ‚ÄãThe Sun report that fresh terms were offered to De Gea earlier this year, with the club always quietly confident that the Spaniard would refute any interest from Real - despite the fact that his partner continues to live in the Spanish capital. That's not to suggest that he would have taken Real up on any offer though - with De Gea reportedly keen to repay the loyalty showed to him during his early struggles at Old Trafford. With the path now clear, United hope that the task to keep De Gea has become that much easier. His current deal expires next June, although the club have the option to extend it by a further 12 months as it stands, and the report suggests that United will look to formalise their offer within the next few weeks. Signing De Gea to a new deal would surely strengthen United's hand in forthcoming transfer windows, with the Spanish number one having firmly established himself as one of the world's best goalkeepers.",TRUE

Chelsea will receive a large loan fee for Batshuayi and have not included an option for Valencia to buy him at the end of the loan. Batshuayi's decision to go could mean Tammy Abraham, who has spent the last two seasons on loan at Bristol City and Swansea City, remains at the club.

According to the report, the 23-year-old is being closely watched by Real Madrid scouts and a bid could soon be forthcoming. Real will not look to sign Sterling before Friday's transfer deadline - there is not enough time to set up the deal and City will definitely not sell as they cannot land a replacement. But Real will supposedly use this season to track the player and ascertain his value. According to Sky Sports , Real will have representatives at Wembley for England's UEFA Nations League clash with Spain on September 8. Sterling is expected to be included in Gareth Southgate's team for the new-form tournament. The player's contract is due to expire in 2020, with Real supposedly seeing that as an opportunity to get him on the cheap. They signed Thibaut Courtois from Chelsea this summer for just ¬£35m, with the goalkeeper having entered the remaining 12 months of his Blues contract. City are likely to offer Sterling a new contract soon, with Kevin De Bruyne, Fernandinho, David Silva and Nicolas Otamendi having all recently penned fresh terms.

Sterling currently earns around ¬£175,000 a week - half the ¬£350,000 weekly wage picked up by his team-mate Kevin De Bruyne.

1019,Atletico Madrid Stopper Jan Oblak Set to Renew His Contract With the Club Before Christmas,"‚ÄãAtletico Madrid keeper Jan Oblak is expected to renew his contract at the Wanda Metropolitano before the winter holidays, with the Spanish side set to increase his wages as well as his release clause. According to ‚ÄãAS , the Slovenian's current ‚Ç¨100m release clause is a huge point of concern for Diego Simeone's side, given the increasing possibility that the figure could be met in the current market. The recent big money moves of Alisson Becker and Kepa Arrizabalaga to Liverpool and Chelsea respectively, has forced the Europa League champions into renegotiating Oblak's contract earlier than they would have preferred. Atletico plan to double the 25-year-old's release clause nearer to the ‚Ç¨200m mark. The Spanish side's impressive summer in the market, in which they notably spent ‚Ç¨70m on Monaco star Thomas Lemar, led some to believe that Oblak would depart to compensate the spending. In 2012/13 Rio Ave Futebol Clube in Portugal's Liga Nos had Ederson and Jan Oblak as goalkeepers at the club. They were just 18 and 19. pic.twitter.com/GYpLc8Jf2t However, ‚ÄãLiverpool , ‚ÄãChelsea and ‚ÄãReal Madrid found alternatives in the goalkeeping position as advances towards Oblak were met with a steely response from Atletico. Both the club and the player seem keen to negotiate a new deal, one that will emphasise Oblak's significance to the team. A new deal for Oblak would represent an important summer for Atletico after they also tied down Antoine Griezmann to fresh terms in the Spanish capital. Atletico Madrid signed Jan Oblak from Benfica for 16mil Euros. https://t.co/nZxYfSTTjN Tying Oblak down would arguably be better business, given the fact that the former Benfica keeper is one of the world's greatest at the moment, if not the best. The recent extortionate fees for goalkeepers highlights the fact that many clubs are realising how important it is to invest significantly in the previously thankless role. ‚ÄãAtletico can count themselves somewhat lucky that no club was willing t o buy out Oblak's ¬£90m release clause this summer, and they would be wise to increase that figure substantially as the market continues to inflate.",TRUE

1021,Jan Oblak Reportedly Set to Sign New Atletico Madrid Contract Amid Exit Rumours,"Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak is reportedly set to bring an end to any speculation regarding his future at the club by signing a new contract. According to Felix Jose Diaz of AS , the stopper is poised to pen fresh terms with the capital club before Christmas, which will see his release clause doubled to a whopping ‚Ç¨200 million (¬£181 million) and his salary increased. ""Atletico enjoyed a very ambitious summer, but Oblak's release clause and movement in the goalkeeping market led to reports of a move for the Slovenian,"" Diaz said. ""The idea is that Atletico will renew the 25-year-old before Christmas with improved terms for him that reflect his importance to the team."" As noted by Diaz, Chelsea were linked with a move for Oblak before they paid a world-record sum to sign Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Bilbao, as were Liverpool before they swooped to secure Alisson Becker from Roma. Real Madrid were also noted as possible suitors before they snapped up Thibaut Courtois to provide competition for Keylor Navas, but now it appears Oblak is ready to commit long-term to an exciting project at the Wanda Metropolitano. For many, the Atletico man is the standout goalkeeper in the world at the moment, and figures like this indicate why: 68 - Since his debut for Atletico in the 2014/15, Jan Oblak has kept the most clean sheets in the top five European leagues (68). Guardian. https://t.co/TVxjEPLWjP While Oblak is assisted in keeping clean sheets by the defensive style of football Atletico play under manager Diego Simeone, that astonishing record is in largely down to him. The 25-year-old excels in all areas of his goalkeeping craft. Oblak is commanding, dynamic and has remarkable reactions, making him difficult for attackers to beat when they do take shots at goal. Given how good he is, it wasn't a shock to see some huge teams linked with Oblak throughout the summer, and for plenty of sides, a release clause of ¬£90 million would've represented a bargain. However, with Chelsea, Liverpool and Real all investing in other goalkeepers, a stay at Atletico appears logical for the Slovenian. La Liga commentator Rob Palmer believes Oblak would've been worth a huge fee for one of those teams this summer: If Chelsea do spend ‚Ç¨90m on Oblak they are investing in possibly the best GK in the world He's up there with, possibly better than, DeGea and Courtois. As Spanish football journalist Kieran Canning noted, Oblak has already made some decisive interventions for Atletico in 2018-19: Two big saves from Oblak ensure Atletico get a point at Mestalla. Proper game, 2 very good teams who should go far in CL this season If Oblak does sign a new deal soon, it would be another positive step for the Madrid outfit. Not only did they recruit well in the summer with the signings of Thomas Lemar, Rodri and Nikola Kalinic, they also tied Antoine Griezmann down to a new contract despite links to Barcelona throughout 2018. After winning the UEFA Europa League last season, Atletico appear in an excellent position to push for major honours again this term and beyond. With Oblak between the sticks, they have an exceptional foundation upon which to do so.",TRUE

Sevilla will pay a fee in the region of ‚Ç¨10 million to re-sign Vidal, who left the club in 2015 for Barca. Vidal, 28, will land in Barcelona on Saturday before completing a medical and finalising his return to the Sanchez Pizjuan. Therefore, he will not be available for Barca's game against AC Milan at Levi's Stadium this weekend, making his appearance in Tuesday's 4-2 loss to Roma his last for the club. Barca paid Sevilla ‚Ç¨18m for Vidal three years ago with the idea of converting him into Dani Alves' long-term replacement at right-back. However, as the club were serving a transfer ban at the time, he was forced to spend six months on the sidelines before he could be officially registered. Once he was granted permission to play in January 2016, though, he failed to recapture the form he had shown at Sevilla which saw him called up to the Spain squad. Under Luis Enrique, he was used at right-back and, just when he looked to be re-finding his best form, he dislocated his ankle against Alaves in 2017, ruling him out for six months. Ernesto Valverde has preferred to use him further forward as a winger, but the signings of Ousmane Dembele and Malcom have left him surplus to requirements. Vidal is set to become new Sevilla coach Pablo Machin's sixth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Sergi Gomez, Roque Mesa, Tomas Vaclik, Joris Gnagnon and Ibrahim Amadou.

The Manchester United boss warned him not to air his grievances in the media and said if he wants to quit the club ""again"" he should ask for a transfer. Pogba hit back by telling Mourinho if he plans to speak to him formally again he should go through his agent Mino Raiola. Mourinho delivered his no-nonsense message after ordering the Frenchman in for showdown talks in the wake of Pogba's comments following United's 2-1 opening-day win over Leicester. An unhappy Pogba had told newspaper reporters: ""There are things I can say and there are things that I cannot say, otherwise I will get fine."" A furious Mourinho told Pogba he did not appreciate those comments and added, ""If you wish to leave Manchester, again, all you have to do is ask for a transfer"". The 'again' was a dig at him having quit the club in 2012 to earn more money at Juventus before his ¬£89million return two years ago. Pogba stood his ground in the meeting and told Mourinho that if he wanted to speak that way to him he should go via Raiola. The spiky talks have taken the pair's relationship to new depths. Mourinho was left bemused by Pogba's post-match comments having made him captain and praised him afterwards. But the bad blood is hanging over from last season when the pair fell out leading to Mourinho dropping and subbing the player. Mourinho is understood to blame agent Raiola for a lot of the unrest with reports of Pogba wanting a move to Barcelona. The United boss had given Pogba the captain's armband against the Foxes as a show of faith in him. Pogba scored a third-minute penalty and was man of the match. After the game Mourinho described Pogba as a ""monster"" for the physical effort he put in so soon after winning the World Cup and also used the words ""fantastic"" and ""amazing"" to describe his performance.

Now Mourinho has told him if he has problems he comes straight to him to talk face-to-face ‚Äî not to make it public. Pogba is understood to have been unhappy with Mourinho's barbed comments during the club's US pre-season tour when assessing his World Cup performance. Mourinho had said: ""I hope he understands why he was very good.""

The two Manchester United heavyweights have been at odds with each other for months and fresh reports have suggested their relationship is now at an all-time low. And the Daily Mail claim Pogba is set on joining Barcelona and even a mend in his relationship with Mourinho would not be enough for him to stay. It is said that Mourinho made an effort to heal their rift by making him captain against Leicester. However, the 55-year-old was then furious with his midfield lynchpin for comments suggesting he unhappy. But, in a big development, the Daily Mail say that Mourinho is just a secondary reason for Pogba wanting out. The United star is reportedly enticed by Barcelona, where he would be able to play alongside Lionel Messi and former Juventus team-mate Arturo Vidal. Pogba has told United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward of his intentions to leave Old Trafford. And, with a transfer looking unlikely this summer, the Red Devils midfielder is willing to wait until January or next year to get his move. To make matters worse for United, Pogba has reportedly already agreed personal terms with Barcelona. The 25-year-old reportedly did so through his agent Raiola, who Mourinho is known to be furious with for his handling of his client.

""We are constructing an excellent squad of players with experience, both homegrown and from elsewhere. This will help us to have success.

1030,West Ham transfer news: Danny Drinkwater deal edging closer ahead of deadline - bookies,"Drinkwater has been disappointing at Chelsea and rarely featured from the start in last season's 22 appearances. And he could be shipped out by Maurizio Sarri before tomorrow's transfer deadline. He has been linked with a move to West Ham and bookmakers Coral rank them as favourites to land the 28-year-old. He is now priced as short as 2/1 to team up with Manuel Pellegrini at the London Stadium. Crystal Palace and Leicester are 3/1 while Everton and Newcastle are both 6/1. ""With Chelsea strengthening their midfield this summer it seems as though Drinkwater will be allowed to leave if a suitable offer comes in before the deadline,"" said Coral's Harry Aitkenhead. ""West Ham lead the chase, but at 2-1 our odds reflect that there's a lot to happen before any deal is confirmed and Crystal Palace and Leicester are also in the hunt."" Drinkwater started in last night's friendly win over Lyon but Chelsea are closing in on a deal for Mateo Kovacic who will join on loan from Real Madrid. Kovacic is reportedly undergoing a medical this afternoon and will join in part of the deal that sees Thibaut Courtois head to Madrid for ¬£35m. Chelsea have already snapped up Jorginho from Napoli this summer and have triggered Kepa's release clause to make him the move expensive goalkeeper in history. Sarri is hoping to reshape his side into title challengers after Antonio Conte took the Blues to fifth last term. West Ham meanwhile have had a busy summer and Drinkwater would be battling Jack Wilshere for a spot in the team. The Hammers have also snapped up Felipe Anderson, Issa Diop, Andriy Yarmolenko, Lukasz Fabianski, Fabian Balbuena, Ryan Fredericks and Wilshere.

1031,Oblak disappointed with Atletico and has no intention of renewing,"Jan Obak has started the season the same way as he finished the last by being decisive for Atletico Madrid. On Saturday, he saved all three points for the club when he saved late on from Rayo's Sergio Moreno. He did the same against Valencia to salvage a point for Atletico. His contract has been given a lot to talk and thought during the last number of weeks. However, As spoke to sources close to the Slovenian and they say he has no intention of sitting down to discuss his future with Atletico for now. The goalkeeper feels a little let down with promises that were made during his last contract extension, which came in February 2016 when his release clause was lifted from ‚Ç¨45 million to ‚Ç¨100 million, and were not kept. Oblak believes that Atletico have had more than enough time to settle the issue and that ""at the moment, it's not a question of money"" as the sources close to the player said. During the sumer, Liverpool were the club most attentive to Oblak's situation but the ‚Ç¨100 million was slightly out of their price range and they eventually signed Alisson for ‚Ç¨80 million. Chelsea also showed interest along with PSG, who respectively signed Kepa for a world record fee and Buffon as a low-cost option.",FALSE
1032,Modric wants to leave but is willing to listen to Real Madrid,"According to sources close to the player, Luka Modric wants to leave Real Madrid , but is willing to listen to what the club has to offer him. It would seem, therefore, that the Croatian's position is more open than that of Cristiano Ronaldo , who was steadfast on leaving Madrid, and compatriot Mateo Kovacic, who has insisted that the club sell him this summer . Nevertheless, Modric is very tempted by the appealing offer that Inter has put on the table. The Italian club has offered him a four-year contract worth 10 million euros net a year , which is a considerable improvement on his current salary. His contract with Real Madrid, which expires in 2020, sees him earn 6.5 million euros net annually. And on top of the staggering 65% pay rise, Inter have reportedly made the proposal even more tempting by offering the 32-year-old an additional two years in China with Jiangsu (the club also owned by Inter's owners) after his four-year spell in Milan, at which point he would be 36. That would mean that Modric would earn 60 million euros over the six-year contractual period, which would end in 2024 when he was 38 years old. Surely, Modric has been seduced by Inter's offer, but his affection for Real Madrid means his decision may not yet be definitive. The Croatian wants to speak with the club and new coach Julen Lopetegui when the squad returns from the U.S. tour after the Roma game on Wednesday night. If Madrid can at least come close to matching Inter's offer, the midfielder will surely opt to stay at the club with whom he has won four Champions League titles and where the fans idolise him. His love and respect for the club and its fans will no doubt weigh a lot on his decision, but so too will his age. He will turn 33 in September, after having been chosen as the World Cup's player of the tournament in July, and this could be his last chance to land such a lucrative contract. Moreover, after having won so many titles at Madrid, he could be tempted by a new challenge in Italy. In any case, there is one major hurdle for the player should he choose Inter: Florentino Perez has declared that he is not leaving for anything less than his 750 million euro release clause . In that case, Modric would have to publically state that he wanted to leave the Bernabeu, a move which could bring a bitter end to his six-year relationship with the club and fans that hold him so dear. Whatever happens, Modric and Real Madrid will have a lot of talking to do over the coming days to clear up his future.",FALSE
1033,Modric's decision to stay at Real Madrid: five reasons,"In response to Inter Milan's attempts to lure Luka Modric to Italy, Real Madrid are to hand the midfielder an improved deal that will bring him into the same wage bracket as Gareth Bale, who currently pockets 11 million euros a season. Inter were offering Modric a six-year contract (four at the San Siro, two at the Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning , whose owners are the Nerazzurri's majority shareholders). AS understands that Modric has, like Karim Benzema and Toni Kroos, been earning about eight million a year at Real. One only needs to compare Real and Inter's recent trophy hauls to see that, by opting to stay at the Bernab√©u, Modric has given himself a much better chance of continuing to challenge for the top silverware on offer . The LaLiga club have won four of the last five Champions Leagues, the last three of which have come in consecutive campaigns. Meanwhile, the Italians' last European crown came eight years ago under Jos√© Mourinho. Family life is a factor that is expected to have had a major bearing on Modric's decision to stay put . Six years have now gone by since his arrival from Tottenham Hotspur - more than enough time for the Croatia captain and his wife and children to have now settled fully into life in the Spanish capital. An unwillingness to uproot them is likely to have influenced his decision to finally reject Inter's overtures . Real's appointment of Julen Lopetegui in place of Zinedine Zidane means their style will remain much as it was under the Frenchman , with an emphasis on possession-based football that embraces patient build-up. With that in mind, it is not lost on Modric that he'll have a key role to play in Lopetegui's side - bringing with it the chance to carry on showing, or even improve on, the form that brought him the Golden Ball award as the 2018 World Cup's best player. In the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's summer move to Juventus, Modric's influence within the dressing room will grow yet further . About to embark on his seventh season with the 13-time European Cup winners, the Croat is now undoubtedly one of the squad's senior figures - and his role within the group will be all the more important now that one if its chief leaders has departed.",TRUE

1054,Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea: Five things to know about Spain keeper,"With Kepa Arrizabalaga seemingly on his way to Chelsea as Thibaut Courtois' replacement , here's five things to know about the Basque goalkeeper. With Chelsea prepared to trigger an ‚Ç¨80 million release clause in his Athletic contract, Kepa is set to become the world's most expensive goalkeeper. Alisson's move to Liverpool is the biggest ever deal for a keeper so far, with Chelsea's hierarchy having reportedly decided last month that ¬£65 million was too much to pay for the Brazil international. Courtois' determination to leave for Real Madrid has led to an apparent change of mind at Stamford Bridge, and even more money has been found to bring in a new top class No.1 Elsewhere in the top 10 biggest keeper transfers are Gianluigi Buffon, Manuel Neuer and David De Gea. They all moved for big money earlier in their careers, and proved to be excellent value over the long term for Juventus, Bayern Munich and Manchester United respectively. Chelsea will be hoping their investment looks equally as wise. Zinedine Zidane put his foot down to stop Madrid signing Kepa during last winter's transfer window, when his release clause was just ‚Ç¨20m. Preisdent Florentino Perez was keen to bring him as part of a policy of snapping up the best young local talent. The move was so close that Kepa was widely reported to have undergone a medical in the Spanish capital on Jan. 4 while Paris Saint Germain were also apparently considering a deal. But Zidane held firm to his public commitment that he did not want reinforcements midseason, a first sign of friction with Perez and something which may have led to Zidane's exit at the end of the campaign. So Kepa signed a new Athletic deal which ran until 2025, containing the much bigger clause. After playing for Spain all the way up the youth ranks, including winning an Under-19 European Championships medal under Julen Lopetegui, a first senior cap arrived in a friendly against Costa Rica last November. Kepa then travelled to the 2018 World Cup as back-up to De Gea, with the United man's poor form through the group stages leading to speculation that interim boss Fernando Hierro would give Kepa a first competitive international game in the round-of-16 clash with Russia. In the end De Gea kept his place, and new La Roja boss Luis Enrique has a choice to make for his first games in charge next month against England and Croatia. Although long-tipped for the top, Kepa's progress into the first team at San Mames was not totally smooth. He has only played a relatively small number of La Liga games (53). The teenager's first call up to the senior Athletic squad came back in May 2012, when Marcelo Bielsa was in charge. But he did not get on to the pitch and then stayed behind Iago Herrerin as understudy to veteran first choice Gorka Iraizoz. That meant loan spells at Segunda sides Ponferradina and Real Valladolid, before Ernesto Valverde finally decided on a first start in September 2016. Kepa did not look back from there, and quickly settled in as first choice at San Mames, with his athleticism and reflexes making it slightly odd that it had taken so long for him to make the breakthrough. Kepa's reputation as a penalty saving specialist began at the U19 Euros in 2012, when he denied France's Samuel Umtiti and Geoffrey Kondogbia in a semifinal shootout, helping Lopetegui's side reach the final. Last season in La Liga went well too, with Kepa saving spot kicks from Villarreal's Manu Trigueros and Malaga's Youssef En-Nesyri.",TRUE
1055,Everton shrewd in deal to sign left-back Lucas Digne from Barcelona,"Spending at Everton has accelerated at such a rate that the past two years have seen them splash more than ¬£300 million on new signings. But the ¬£18 million signing of Barcelona left-back Lucas Digne at least hints at a level of astuteness absent in several recent transfers. The 25-year-old defender is approaching his peak years, and his arrival strengthens a position in desperate need of additional depth and quality. Digne has a chance to push for the regular first-team football he was missing out on at Barcelona, while Everton finally recruit much-needed competition for 33-year-old Leighton Baines, who has stood as the only recognised left-back in the squad since understudy Bryan Oviedo moved to Sunderland in January 2017. Failure to address the left-back situation has seen Baines overworked and Everton one injury away from a crisis, which became a reality last season when Baines missed 18 successive matches through injury and third-choice right-back Cuco Martina was pushed into an emergency left-back role. It is impractical to expect a 33-year-old to emerge unscathed through an entire season in a demanding league. This same lack of care and attention toward defensive recruitment has seen central defence fall into a similar state of disrepair. Digne, meanwhile, will want to recapture the form he showed during a productive loan spell at Roma in 2015-16, as high-profile moves to Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona provided more frustration than football. In the four seasons either side of his solitary campaign in Rome, Digne did not start more than 15 league games in a season. His two years at Barcelona amounted to just 22 league starts. Inevitable excitement at a new signing often leads to a clamour to thrust the player straight into the team, but it is too easy to overlook those already in place. Baines has shown remarkable consistency despite nobody suffering more than him for Everton's failure to replace Steven Pienaar on the left side of midfield. (New ¬£40 million signing Richarlison has shown early promise as the latest proposed solution in the role.) Age may have gradually slowed the marauding Baines of old, but the continued absence of an intelligent midfielder to work alongside has hurt his game just as much as the effects of time. His longevity at this level is especially impressive under the circumstances and helps explain his status as the only defender to reach 50 Premier League assists (53). Baines has also demonstrated refreshing loyalty in a modern game short on it, never pushing for an exit despite persistent interest over the years from clubs able to offer more money and silverware. In fact there were times under former manager David Moyes when Baines carried Everton, and this was never more apparent than the 2012-13 season. Mikel Arteta and Pienaar had left the season before, depriving Everton of their two most creative players and leaving the squad desperately short on guile and creativity. Baines took up the creative mantle in spectacular fashion and ended the season as the only outfield player to play every minute of every league game on his way to creating a league-high 116 chances. Pienaar eventually returned in the January transfer window, Baines seamlessly continued his excellent form and the pair resumed their productive partnership on the left. Baines alone accounted for 24 percent of the chances created by the entire Everton squad that season, culminating in a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and Everton's Player of the Season and Players' Player of the Season awards. Baines accomplished all of that from the left-back position. To put that into context, the list of players ending subsequent Premier League seasons as the most creative consists exclusively of attacking midfielders: Eden Hazard (twice), Mesut Ozil, Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne. Of those, only Ozil bettered the 116 chances created by Baines in 2012-13. Baines may not be capable of such exceptional exploits at this stage of his career, but the experienced left-back is unlikely to concede his starting place to Digne without resistance. This competitiveness is welcome progress as Everton switch from a team with only one recognised left-back for the past 18 months to a side with two viable starting options as manager Marco Silva continues to rebuild a broken squad. The respective ages of the two players and the time taken to convince Digne to swap the Camp Nou for Goodison Park rightly suggest the 25-year-old France international is the future for Everton in this position. Whether this changing of the guard at left-back is immediate or gradual, one thing is certain: Digne has one hell of an act to follow as Baines' successor.",TRUE
1056,Xherdan Shaqiri move a no-brainer for Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp,"The ink had barely dried on Harry Wilson's new five year contract when reports emerged of Liverpool opening talks with Stoke City over the signing of Swiss forward Xherdan Shaqiri. The arrival of Shaqiri would severely restrict any first team opportunities Wilson might have had this season, so it's safe to assume the young Welshman was fully aware of it before he signed a new deal and that a plan is in place for his future development. That plan almost certainly involves another season away from Merseyside. Virtually the entire Championship have enquired about taking Wilson on loan, while both Celtic and Rangers would like him to be playing his football in Glasgow this season. There are no shortage of suitors. Supporters may prefer to see him at a Premier League club, where he can test himself at the top level, but that could be counter-productive. Wilson's development would be better served playing in a good attacking side that goes out to win every week. It's all well and good wanting him to go to Huddersfield or Newcastle, but it would be pointless if he wasn't playing regularly or if he spent most of his time having to defend because the team were battling relegation. Wilson was a revelation at Hull City last season. A good barometer of a successful loan is to ask: if this player wasn't already at your club, would you be interested in signing him? For most of Liverpool's loanees over recent years, the answer to that is a resounding ""no."" Would the Reds be in for Divock Origi or Daniel Sturridge based on what they did on loan? Or Ryan Kent or Sheyi Ojo? Wilson was the exception. He lit up the Championship last season, and another year of the same could see him returning to Anfield ready to take up a permanent spot in Klopp's match day squad. He's looked impressive so far in preseason and scored twice at Chester last weekend. It would make sense for Klopp to keep him around for a few more weeks to further assess him (and to ensure there are no hitches with the Shaqiri deal) before sanctioning any loan move. All things considered though, signing Shaqiri is a no brainer for Liverpool. Wilson isn't yet at the level of the experienced Swiss, and it would have been a risk going into the season with him as the main alternative to Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Even Wilson's biggest supporters cannot say for sure that he would be capable of playing 25 games at the required level this year. Shaqiri should be able to provide quality back up at the very least and perhaps even serious competition. There is risk in every signing and Shaqiri is no different, but a reported ¬£13m release clause in his Stoke contract makes a deal for him almost too good to turn down, especially financially. Liverpool's bean counters will certainly be rubbing their hands over this one but it also appeals on a football level too. From a business perspective, even if Shaqiri were to flop, his price is so low that Liverpool would still make money on him in a year. By that time, Wilson would have had another full season under his belt to prepare himself for the step up to Liverpool's first team. If Shaqiri is a success, his value would skyrocket given the way transfer fees are rising each year. Liverpool could easily double or triple their money on him if they wanted to move him on and bring Wilson through. And there's no reason to think Shaqiri wouldn't perform well, as he is a quality player. There seems to be a narrative around him that he's lazy and therefore won't be a good fit for Liverpool's high octane pressing game. You know what's lazy? That narrative. Shaqiri has been playing on teams that don't ask him to press high or track back chasing after the full back. At half-time during Switzerland's recent World Cup group match against Brazil, Gary Neville and the rest of the ITV crew were laying into Shaqiri for not chasing Marcelo all over the park. Neville was speaking as a former right-back who was used to getting protection and help from whoever was playing in front of him. Yet the Swiss right-back, Stephan Lichtsteiner, is their captain and one of their most experienced players. If Shaqiri wasn't doing what he was supposed to, surely Lichtsteiner would have let him know, as would the coach. Since neither of them seemed bothered about Shaqiri hanging around in the space vacated by Marcelo, is it not a fair assumption that this was the actual plan? Salah is often deployed in the same way by Liverpool. One of the midfielders will shuffle across to help out the full-back while Salah waits in space to launch a counter. Does this make him lazy too? Shaqiri has been playing for Stoke, a team who had little other attacking talent. He was often their only creative spark, so it would be silly having him wear himself out constantly chasing back and defending, particularly considering Stoke were so poor that defending was all they did most of the time. Klopp does not tolerate shirkers, so if Liverpool sign Shaqiri it's because he feels that he can adapt to Liverpool's style. Rather than seeing this as a blow to his first team prospects, Wilson should see Shaqiri coming to Liverpool as a positive, as the Swiss would be more of a placeholder than anything else. The time for Wilson to worry would be if the Reds signed a Julian Brandt or a Christian Pulisic.",TRUE

Odriozola is a promising young defender whose performances for Real Sociedad last season earned him a place at the World Cup. Spain have plenty of options in that position, and Odriozola made the cut ahead of more established players like Barcelona's Sergi Roberto and Arsenal 's Hector Bellerin. The full-back featured in the group games against Switzerland and Spain, although it was a disappointing tournament for La Roja as they suffered defeat to hosts Russia in the last 16. The youngster will now head to the Santiago Bernabeu and will cost Real Madrid ‚Ç¨40 million (¬£35.3 million), per Roberto Ramajo at AS . Odriozola will add to Real Madrid's depth at right-back. Dani Carvajal is the club's first choice, while Nacho Fernandez can play at right-back or in central defence. The club also have 19-year-old Achraf Hakimi, who is expected to join Borussia Dortmund on a two-year loan, per Marca . La Liga writer Andrew Gaffney offered his view on the signing: Real Madrid sign rapid right back Alvaro Odriozola from Real Sociedad. No word on the fee but he's signed a six-year deal. Very, very good signing. #alreadyspendingthatcristianomoney https://t.co/kwBSmvocG4 The move sees Real Madrid continue to bring young Spanish players to the Santiago Bernabeu as they look to the future. Odriozola follows players such as Dani Ceballos, Jesus Vallejo and Marco Asensio in making the move to Real Madrid. Freelance football writer Simon Harrison showed how the deal works out for Real Sociedad: Odriozola's release clause stood at 40 million euros. His sale is capable of funding ten years of academy development. Looking at their success over the last decade in bringing youngsters through, exciting to see what they do over the next one.

He is a central midfielder with great vision, is excellent in possession and looks as though he can follow in the footsteps of club legends Andres Iniesta and Xavi. FootballTalentScout showed what he can bring to the Camp Nou: Arthur is officially Barcelona player! - perfect mix of deep-lying playmaker &amp; box-to-box midfielder - very fast, dynamic &amp; mobile - great technique &amp; ball control - superb passing skills &amp; ability to carry the ball - very good in combination play/under pressure Great transfer! https://t.co/Dno6XqBE6W The midfielder has caught Barcelona's eye with his performances for Gremio. He was named the best midfielder of the season in April and has won the Copa do Brasil and the Copa Libertadores with Gremio. He has featured for Brazil at Under-17 and Under-20 level and was called up to the senior Brazil squad for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile, although he is yet to make his full international debut. Football writer Paulo Freitas said he's ready for the senior side: @OneRafaB I think both are ready for the national team, especially Arthur, I think both will become top players. Arthur spoke about his move to the Camp Nou in a press conference to announce his departure from Gremio on Friday, per Football Espana . He said: ""I'm fulfilling a dream and I have to thank [Gremio] for this. It's not a goodbye but rather a 'see you later' and I hope to be able to come back one day."" Arthur's arrival comes in the wake of Paulinho's departure from Barcelona to former side Guangzhou Evergrande after just one season at the Camp Nou. His exit has freed up one of Barcelona's three non-EU spots in the squad, per The Independent . That spot now appears to have gone to Arthur with Philippe Coutinho and Yerry Mina taking the other two places. Much will be expected of Arthur at Barcelona as he has been so highly-rated, although it's likely that manager Ernesto Valverde will slowly assimilate him into his team at first. The youngster will need time to adjust to a new country and a new league, but if he can live up to his apparent potential Barcelona may have a rare talent on their hands.",TRUE

1070,Jurgen Klopp addresses Loris Karius transfer speculation,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is unaware of reports linking goalkeeper Loris Karius with a move to Turkish side Besiktas. Widespread reports on Monday suggested that the German stopper has agreed a two-year loan to the Super Lig side. Karius' future has been uncertain since his error-strewn display in the Champions League final against Real Madrid and the arrival of Alisson Becker from Roma for a world record fee. But speaking after the 2-0 Premier League win at Crystal Palace, Klopp claimed to be in the dark over the future of the 25-year-old. ""Nothing to say,"" Klopp told reporters. ""Nobody told me anything on a transfer."" Despite featuring for Liverpool in pre-season, Karius' days at Anfield look to be numbered just two years after his arrival from Mainz. The Liverpool Echo have detailed the terms of the deal which could see the club recoup as much as ¬£9.5m. Besiktas will pay ¬£2.25m for Karius for the initial 24-month loan with a clause inserted in the deal for it to become permanent if a number of conditions are met. These include Besiktas qualifying consistently for Europe and Karius making a sufficient number of appearances. The 15-time Turkish champions will have to pay ¬£7.25m to make the move permanent at the end of the loan, with Liverpool having already negotiated a 20% sell-on clause. The terms of the agreement mean Liverpool are likely to make a profit on the ¬£4.75m they paid for Karius in May 2016, in spite of his dire performances on Merseyside. Though the Premier League transfer window closed on 9 August, clubs in Turkey have until 31 August to sign players this summer giving Besiktas over a week to complete the deal. Should an agreement be reached then Karius will sign a one-year contract extension until 2022 to protect his value, with an option for an additional 12 months. Danny Ward has already joined Leicester City for ¬£12.5m and Karius is likely to join him out the exit door after failing to find a club willing to match their ¬£12m valuation of Simon Mignolet, who is braced to act as the number two to Alisson.",TRUE

The Frenchman spent the last season on loan with ‚ÄãStoke City , making 37 appearances in all competitions. He was a key player for Stoke, but was unable to prevent the club from suffering relegation to the ‚ÄãChampionship . Zouma has long been regarded as one of the most promising defenders in the world, and was in the midst of a breakout season with Chelsea during the 2015/16 season when he unfortunately suffered a horrific knee injury which sidelined him for almost an entire year. The loan to Stoke City was seen as the perfect move to allow him to regain his match fitness, but it appears as though Zouma is still not in Chelsea's immediate plans. The London club currently have Andreas Christensen, David Luiz and Gary Cahill as their senior centre backs, whilst young Ethan Ampadu had a very impressive pre-season in that position. Everton needed to bring in more central defenders following the departures of Ashley Williams and Ramiro Funes Mori, and they have acted to bring in two incredibly promising young defenders in Zouma and Mina. Zouma has made over 100 appearances in English football and Everton will be hoping that he will be able to help rejuvenate their defence for the upcoming season.",TRUE

The former Spain Under-21 international left Barca for Celta in 2014 and has gone on to make 134 appearances for the Galicians, while the fee of his move is said to be around the ‚Ç¨5m mark. However, with only one year left on his Celestes contract, he has become Sevilla's fourth summer signing after Roque Mesa, Tomas Vaclik and Ibrahim Amadou.",TRUE

1108,Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea: All you need to know about him,"We profile Kepa Arrizabalaga as the Spanish goalkeeper completes a big-money transfer to Chelsea... Faced with the loss of Thibaut Courtois, Chelsea have broken the world transfer record for a goalkeeper in paying ¬£71.6m to bring in Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Bilbao. It is a huge decision to sign a 23-year-old with only one cap for Spain to his name. But in an inflated market, this was arguably a necessary move to avoid an alarming dip in quality. Jack Butland would have been the more straightforward option. A fee of ¬£30m might have been enough to prise him away from relegated Stoke City. But given that Butland has only a middling record - think of his costly mistake at Leicester or the two goals conceded against Everton - the risk was that Chelsea would have been back in the market again soon. In moving for Kepa, the hope is that Maurizio Sarri has secured Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper on a long-term basis. If he is not quite the best 'keeper in Europe, he is at least part of the discussion. Kepa came close to joining Real Madrid in January and was part of Spain's World Cup squad this summer. This is a player of considerable talent. Like many academy graduates at Athletic Bilbao , Kepa took his first steps into senior football at fourth-tier feeder club Basconia before representing Bilbao Athletic - the Basque club's B team. There were then second-tier loan spells at Ponferradina and Real Valladolid, where he gained more valuable experience. It served him well when he returned to Atheltic Bilbao in 2016 and became their first-choice goalkeeper in Ernesto Valverde's final year in charge. The current Barcelona coach awarded him his debut in La Liga away to Deportivo La Coruna and was soon praising his ""great maturity"" in the role. ""He has some things that he knows he has to improve,"" said Valverde later that season, after Kepa had helped Athletic qualify for Europe. ""But he is a goalkeeper with good reflexes, a great presence and a great confidence that he transmits to others."" In November 2017, he duly made his senior debut for Spain in a 5-0 win over Costa Rica. The reflexes that Valverde spoke of are supported by the statistics. Kepa is an impressive shot-stopper. Not only did he save two of the three penalties that he faced in La Liga last season but he produced 64 saves from inside the penalty area - the third most of any goalkeeper in the competition. While he is also impressive with the ball at his feet, Kepa will still need to adjust to the passing style of play that Sarri prefers. At Athletic, he made more accurate long balls - 368 - than any other goalkeeper in La Liga last season but there will be a greater emphasis on the short stuff at Chelsea where he must build from the back. Of course, replacing Courtois will be a huge challenge. Despite Chelsea underperforming last season, the Belgium number one did not make a single error leading to a goal in his 35 Premier League appearances. Kepa made two such errors at Athletic last season and the scrutiny of being the world's most expensive goalkeeper will mean they must be cut out. There is at least the example of Kepa's Spain team-mate David de Gea to provide inspiration. The Manchester United goalkeeper endured a difficult start to his career in the Premier League as he took time to adapt to the physicality of the competition, but he has since flourished and established himself as perhaps the world's best in his position. Kepa's move to Chelsea comes just a few months after he rejected an offer from Real Madrid, instead signing a new seven-and-a-half year contract at Athletic Bilbao containing the ¬£71.6m buy-out clause the Blues decided to trigger this week. ""Those who are close to me know that I am a person who likes to analyse everything before making a decision,"" he said at the time. ""I have taken my time and I want to thank the club that respected it to make my decision."" Kepa said he intended to stay at his boyhood club for a ""long time"", but the chance to succeed Courtois at Chelsea was evidently too good to refuse. Maurizio Sarri: ""I saw him one year ago. My first impression was that he is a very good goalkeeper, very young, but very, very good."" Athletic Bilbao midfielder Mikel San Jose: ""We all know he is a great goalkeeper and he is always relaxed. He transmits calmness to us. We never see him nervous or in any type of doubt."" Ernesto Valverde: ""You can see that he is a player you can trust."" Kepa is some time away from earning those plaudits regardless of the transfer fee. But while Chelsea are clearly paying a premium for his services, they are nevertheless acquiring one of the most gifted young goalkeepers in Europe. The step up to become Athletic's number one at such a young age was not easy. Doing the same at Chelsea will be even tougher.

1109,Mateo Kovacic to Chelsea: Can Maurizio Sarri unlock his potential?,"Chelsea have agreed the loan signing of Mateo Kovacic from Real Madrid. He is a huge talent but unlocking his true potential is the challenge now, writes Adam Bate. When Inter signed Mateo Kovacic at the age of 18 they were acquiring the signature of one of Europe's most coveted teenage prodigies. There was hardly a major club on the continent that had not had their eye on the midfielder from Dinamo Zagreb. It was clear that Inter, the club with which he had once trained as a 10-year-old boy, had pulled off a coup. Croatian legend Zvonimir Boban described Kovacic at the time as ""the complete midfielder"" before adding: ""I would say that he has the potential to become a better player than I was."" The iconic Inter captain Javier Zanetti swiftly declared that this was the most promising youngster that he had seen at the club since the great Ronaldo rocked up there in 1997. It was always going to be tricky to live up to those expectations, especially when handed the No 10 shirt. Kovacic was in and out under Walter Mazzarri in the 2013/14 season and the situation did not improve once Roberto Mancini returned to the San Siro. He was urged to work on consistency but how was that supposed to come without consistency of selection? He was sold to Real Madrid in 2015 just days after Zanetti had declared that the club had ""total faith"" in him, but with Inter no nearer to solving the Kovacic conundrum. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic insisted that he had ""the ability to become the best player in the world in his position"". The problem was that it was still not clear what that position was. Boban saw this flexibility as an asset but it did not always feel that way for Kovacic. In Italy, he was a left-winger and an attacking midfielder as well as a deep-lying playmaker. He took Andrea Pirlo and Luka Modric as reference points - ""I like to be in the heart of the action"" - but others disagreed. Giovanni Trapattoni described him as ""a mix of Kaka and Seedorf"". Anyone who can be compared to no fewer than three of AC Milan's classic Champions League winning team of 2007 evidently has an unusual skill-set. Kovacic can dribble but he likes to play from deep. He does not have the defensive qualities preferred in a holder but is not purposeful enough as a No.10 either, where goals and assists are the only currency. Andrea Stramaccioni, his first coach at Inter, worked this out pretty quickly. ""He won't be playing in the hole as he did as a kid,"" he had explained, while also noting that Kovacic ""does not give you that protection in front of the backline"" either. Classy and elegant, yes. But it is tempting to wonder whether Kovacic has too often been defined by what he is not. ""He is not a typical defensive midfielder,"" pointed out then Real Madrid coach Rafa Benitez upon Kovacic's arrival in the Spanish capital. ""He offers quality. He goes forward, he's dynamic, and uses the ball well."" He did all of those things throughout his three seasons with Real Madrid - and the statistics highlight this rare combination of gifts. Kovacic ranked fourth in La Liga for completed dribbles per 90 minutes last season. He also ranked ninth for total passes per 90 minutes and 14th for tackles. Nobody else in Spain was among the top 25 players in the competition for these three disciplines. Kovacic clearly contributed, but only intermittently. Eleven of his 21 appearances came from the bench. In total, he has made 109 appearances for the world's most successful football club, concluding each of his three seasons there with a Champions League triumph. Just as telling is that he has not started in any of those three finals. It sums up his career so far that he was involved in five of Croatia's seven games in Russia this summer but not the World Cup final. At 24, there is plenty of time to become the heartbeat of a team with the matches to match the medals. It took time for Pirlo to find his natural role but he eventually flourished only when a team was built around him. It was impossible to persuade Real Madrid to do that for Kovacic. It is unlikely to be the plan that Chelsea have for their latest loan signing either. Maurizio Sarri already has his playmaker in Jorginho, nobody can rival N'Golo Kante in that box-to-box midfield role and Chelsea have various creative options further forwards. But Kovacic can be an asset in any of those positions. Perhaps the flexibility that has proven so problematic in his career so far is precisely what appeals to his latest employers. That is good news for his prospects of getting on the Stamford Bridge pitch. It is rather less clear whether this increases or decreases his chances of evolving into the consistent world-class performer that many fine judges have long expected him to become. It is still exciting. Premier League audiences are about to get a close-up look at the Mateo Kovacic enigma. Comment below to get involved in the debate, but please adhere to our House Rules.

Barcelona have announced Everton will pay them a loan fee of ¬£2m for Gomes and will also cover the midfielder's wages in full. Gomes, who won the European Championships with Portugal in 2016, has found regular first-team football hard to come by at the Nou Camp since joining the Catalans in a big-money move from Valencia in 2016.

We have a good mix because we have experienced players who have played here for a few years and we can learn together and get the club higher up the table.""

""Some games we deserved to win, but football is like this and we are unbeaten, which is positive. We need to win the next game to continue what we have started."" Everton are next in action on Super Sunday when they host West Ham, live on Sky Sports . Digne started last time out in the 1-1 draw against Huddersfield and registered an assist when he set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin to score. He added: ""It's important for the full-back to be decisive in attack but it's not the most important thing. You need to be a good defender before you attack and I am very happy to help the team.

Grant has had a good professional career, amassing more than 500 appearances at clubs including Derby County, Sheffield Wednesday and Burnley and made five appearances for Stoke last season, three in the Premier League. He played against Manchester United in the 2016-2017 season when deputising for the injured Jack Butland, including a man of the match performance at Old Trafford in October 2016. Stoke drew with Jose Mourinho's side on that occasion and Grant will have caught the eye playing 28 Premier League games that season until Butland returned. He is joining United on a free agent deal with the likelihood that he will sign a one-year contract. The top clubs have always found it difficult to have good options at third choice when the likelihood is that the player in question will not feature at all during the season - but it is a position all managers' want covered. G rant only made his Premier League in 2016 when he originally arrived at Stoke on loan as cover for the injured Butland.

Chelsea have no intention of selling Loftus-Cheek, even though other clubs have shown interest in securing him on a permanent deal, but they are willing to consider another loan move for the midfielder. Loftus-Cheek could sign a new long-term contract before leaving Stamford Bridge on a temporary basis. Chelsea fans have long called for the inclusion of Loftus-Cheek in the club's plans moving forward, and any decision to not utilise him in 2018/19 is sure to anger the Stamford Bridge faithful.",TRUE

Banega , 29, hadn't started Argentina's previous two matches under Jorge Sampaoli but put in a brilliant showing to help his nation in their time of need.

6,Kroos: Manchester United set to go after Real Madrid man,"Manchester United are set to pursue the summer signing of Real Madrid's Toni Kroos . AS has learned that Kroos' name figured prominently in recent talks held by United manager Jos√© Mourinho and the club's chief executive, Ed Woodward, on 2018/19 squad planning. It is understood that Mourinho feels he would be the ideal addition to the side's midfield, and that his presence in the engine room could bring out the best in Paul Pogba . United, whose aim is to persuade the 28-year-old Germany international to be one of the leaders of the Premier League club's new project, are willing to dig deep to secure Kroos' services. However, they are well aware that it would not be a straightforward deal to complete . Real Madrid have no intention of selling a player whose stock continues to rise - particularly in the wake of his stunning World Cup goal against Sweden, and despite Die Mannschaft's shock first-round exit from Russia 2018 - and who has become a cornerstone of Los Blancos' team. A regular under every coach he has worked with at Real since his 2014 switch from Bayern Munich, he is, together with Luka Modric and Casemiro, a key midfield presence at the European champions , and is earmarked for an equally crucial role under new boss Julen Lopetegui. Real are therefore expected to tell any potential suitors that they will have to trigger the 500m-euro release clause in Kroos' contract - which still has another four years to run - if they want to prise him away from the Bernab√©u.",FALSE
7,Liverpool transfer news: Real Madrid star Marco Asensio tempted after Reds make promise,"Liverpool have been linked with Real Madrid forward Asensio with reports claiming they could launch a huge ¬£158million bid. The Spain international, who may leave the Bernabeu this summer, is currently on international duty with Spain at the World Cup. Asensio has struggled for game time at Real with Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco and Gareth Bale above him in the pecking order. Liverpool are ready to welcome him to Merseyside with open arms after missing out on Lyon hotshot Nabil Fekir. And Spanish newspaper Marca say Asensio is tempted to move to Anfield as he mulls over his options. It is claimed that Liverpool are willing to offer him a significant pay rise to entice him to Anfield. Asensio could even be given the No 10 shirt that has been left vacant ever since Philippe Coutinho's move to Barcelona in January. And Marca claim the Spain youngster may also be tempted because of what Liverpool can promise him. The report says the Reds are willing to offer Asensio a role as one of their talismans. At the moment, that mantle is occupied by Mohamed Salah. But if Liverpool were to make Asensio their most-expensive signing ever, then he would be too. Meanwhile, Asensio's agent recently confirmed Real Madrid had received an offer for his client. And he also suggested it had come from an English club. Horacio Gaggioli said: ""He has an extraordinary future. ""You can imagine that [the offers] come from England because they can afford it without any problems. ""They could even raise it.""",FALSE
8,Manchester United in talks to sign Lee Grant from Stoke,"Manchester United are in talks with Stoke City over a possible deal for 35-year-old goalkeeper Lee Grant, Sky Sports News understands. It is understood Stoke would allow him to leave on a free transfer and United want him as cover should there be injuries to senior keepers David de Gea and Sergio Romero. It is likely Grant would be third choice, initially, with Portugal U21 goalkeeper Joel Pereira to be sent on loan to get more experience. Negotiations are still at an early stage but are progressing. Stoke signed Grant on a permanent deal from Derby in January 2017 after he was initially brought in on loan as cover for the then-injured Jack Butland.

10,Manchester United transfer news: Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos targeted as partner for Paul Pogba,"Jose Mourinho wants to reinforce his engine room with the signing Toni Kroos. Manchester United 's manager sees the Real Madrid ace as the man to bring out the best in Paul Pogba and the duo could form a dream partnership in midfield. According to Spanish publication AS, Kroos' name came up a number of times in talks between Mourinho and the club's chief executive, Ed Woodward, about planning for the new season. United are willing to pay a sizeable fee for the 28-year-old but, understandably, the Spanish giants are not keen to sell and there will be some rigorous negotiating required considering his reported release clause is ‚Ç¨500m. Kroos is one of the world's best in his position and has been a key player in Real's three successive Champions League wins, where he has played alongside Luka Modric and Casemiro. He should be well rested, too given he was part of Germany's faltering World Cup squad. Kroos was heavily linked with United before deciding to join Real Madrid in 2014. Mourinho has already strengthened the centre of the park by adding Fred to his squad in addition to full-back Diogo Dalot.

11,Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid future in doubt as release clause is reportedly slashed by Spanish giants,"Cristiano Ronaldo's release clause has been dramatically lowered to ¬£100million by Real Madrid, according to reports. The 33-year-old's future at Real Madrid is under huge speculation despite the fact he is currently representing Portugal at the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. Ronaldo wanted to sign a new contract worth ¬£1.35m but the LaLiga giants have no intention of agreeing to that. And now the European champions may be prepared to let Ronaldo go as he is not getting any younger. Marca claims that the five-time Ballon d'Or winners' exit from the Bernabeu is getting closer after his release clause has been lowered from ¬£884m to ¬£100m. Paris Saint-Germain are one of very few clubs who could afford to land the forward but face the danger of falling foul of Uefa's Financial Fair Play restrictions.

12,Cristiano Ronaldo to Man Utd: Portuguese star determined to leave Real Madrid - reports,"That's the suggestion of the Manchester Evening News . They say that Ronaldo is thought to have made his mind up that he intends to leave the Bernabeu following nine seasons in the Spanish capital. Ronaldo declared after the Champions League final that it was ""very nice"" to have been in Madrid, speaking in the past tense which inferred that his spell with Los Blancos had come to an end. Days later, the Portuguese star insisted that he did not regret his comments and that an update on his long-term future would be imminent. The 33-year-old indicated that ""in a week"" he would say more but nearly a month on, he has yet to reveal his plans. But the MEN's latest update says that Ronaldo is keen to leave Real Madrid, following four Champions League wins in five years and three in a row, and crucially for United fans - remain in Europe. Although there would likely be lucrative offers on the table from China, the former United fans' favourite is keen to play in England again or move to France or Italy. The MEN say that the Red Devils' chief executive Ed Woodward has long been keen on bringing Ronaldo back to Old Trafford having deemed it a mistake that his ¬£85million departure was ever allowed. Ronaldo has repeatedly been linked with a United return, sometimes using such speculation as a deliberate ploy to force Real Madrid to improve their contract offer. The La Liga giants are said to be in talks with Ronaldo over a new deal with the forward at the moment. Ronaldo, who has starred at the World Cup for Portugal with four goals in two games, including a hat-trick against Spain, is reportedly demanding to be paid similar wages to Ballon d'Or rivals Lionel Messi and Neymar. United would have to sanction huge wages and a massive transfer fee to sign Ronaldo and while they have the funds - that would damage Jose Mourinho's hopes of strengthening across the squad, the MEN say. Ronaldo's own mother recently declared that, amid links to Paris Saint-Germain to join forces with former Barcelona ace Neymar, she would prefer Ronaldo to move back to Manchester. She said to French TV: ""I like Paris. I come every now and again. ""Convince Cristiano to sign for PSG? To be honest, it wouldn't annoy me [if he did], but I would prefer him to return to Manchester United."" United have made two signings so far this summer in Fred and Diogo Dalot. Mourinho is also said to want a new first-choice centre-back and has been linked with several left-backs.",TRUE

Following the game Ronaldo told reporters: ""In the next few days I will give an answer to the fans that have always been on my side. ""It was very nice to be at Real Madrid , in the coming days I will talk about it more."" The bombshell put United on red alert, with Jose Mourinho keen for a reunion with the superstar. Reports in Spain have suggested that Ronaldo could be set for a sensational return to the Premier League, nine years after joining Real. And according to Don Balon , a Spanish outlet famous for its outlandish claims, the deal is edging closer. The report claims that Neymar is in regular contact with Real president Florentino Perez, with the Spaniards keen to sign the Brazilian this summer. The PSG star is only interested in a return to La Liga if Ronaldo is sold and he has been given reassurances that Ronaldo will not be at the Bernabeu next season. Don Balon claim that Neymar has relayed this information to former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi. Ronaldo is reportedly keen on the move as he believes teams in the Premier League are tactically inferior, meaning he'll be able to stand out even more. United are desperate for fresh faces this summer as they look to challenge fierce rivals Manchester City for the Premier League title. Mourinho has already snapped up Brazilian midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk, as well as Porto youngster Diogo Dalot.",FALSE
14,Chelsea brace themselves for Man Utd to kick-off Willian bidding war with Barcelona,"The Stamford Bridge club expect Manchester United to make their move for the Brazil international, with Old Trafford chief Jose Mourinho intent on recruiting Willian this summer, and set to start a bidding war. Mourinho is a major fan of Willian, who was one of the few Chelsea players to perform for him as his second spell at Stamford Bridge unravelled in 2015. Barcelona have though moved first for the Brazilian with a substantial bid, as they look for reinforcements following the departure of Nou Camp legend Andres Iniesta. Willian, who has been at Stamford Bridge for five years, turns 30 in August and Chelsea could be tempted to cash in if Barca's offer is substantially increased. The former Anzhi star impressed in Chelsea's Champions League knockout stage clash with Barca, scoring in the 1-1 home draw before the West Londoners crashed out 4-1 on aggregate. As with several other Chelsea players though, Willian's future at Stamford Bridge could well depend on the intentions of incoming manager Maurizio Sarri. The Brazilian was never a favourite of outgoing boss Antonio Conte, who dropped him for last season's FA Cup final win over United. But Conte is poised to be axed over the next few days to make way for former Napoli manager Sarri. Willian, currently in Russia with Brazil, for whom he has started all three matches, has made no overtures to move from Chelsea, but with the club missing out on Champions League football next season, a switch to the Nou Camp could be tempting, as could a link up again with Mourinho. Chelsea though would be reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, which could leave the way open for Barcelona.",FALSE

It comes as a major boost to Jose Mourinho who was reluctant to lose two central midfielders in one summer, along with Michael Carrick. Several teams across the world have been showing an interest, including Fenerbahce, Roma, Paris St-Germain and both Milan clubs. But one of the more shocking clubs to be looking into the signing of the former Everton star was Arsenal. Jack Wilshere is set to leave the Gunners on a free and Fellaini would have helped replace the Englishman.

Instead, he promised to stay and fight for a place at Old Trafford - where he must compete with new signing Fred. The Brazil international joined the Red Devils for ¬£52m earlier this summer.

""It's a great move by the club to sign him on a permanent deal. This boy has still got a lot of improvement and learning to do but he's a fantastic young talent."" Rodgers, however, is still keen to strengthen in other areas following the departures of Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts. Midfielder Armstrong joined Southampton in a ¬£7m deal and winger Roberts has gone back to Manchester City after completing his loan spell. ""We know we need to strengthen,"" Rodgers added.

Ronaldo is 33 and new boss Julen Lopetegui has been tasked with reshaping an ageing squad that finished 17 points behind La Liga champions Barcelona last season. Juventus have seized their opportunity amid the uncertainty and a bid of 100m euros will tempt the Galaticos. Juventus' current transfer record currently stands at ¬£79m for Gonzalo Higuain in 2016.

The towering defender struggled to make an impact in his maiden campaign at the Nou Camp last season and made just six appearances, only four of which were starts. That has seen him linked with arch rivals Liverpool since earlier this year. But Everton boss Marco Silva has identified Mina as the man to help improve his back-line for the 2018-19 campaign, with the club's director of football - Marcel Brands - also keen. Ex-Hull and Watford manager Silva has yet to make his first signing at Goodison Park while they focus on trimming their squad with Wayne Rooney the headline departure so far. But Barca are reportedly keen to sign Sevilla's Clement Lenglet in a ¬£35m deal while fellow summer arrival Arthur from Gremio takes the Catalan club over the limit for non-EU players in their squad. La Liga rules dictate that clubs can only have three players from outside of the European Union in their first team squad, with Brazilian trio Philippe Coutinho, Paulinho and Arthur to fill up that quota. That could see former Palmeiras prospect Mina, who has a ‚Ç¨100m (¬£88m) buy-out clause in his Barca contract, allowed to leave. Discussions between the La Liga champions and Everton are understood to have already begun with Goal suggesting that Barca's initial aims were to loan Mina out. Ernesto Valverde's side could be willing to sanction a permanent transfer if a buy-back clause can be negotiated into the player's Everton contract.

1035,Barca's Rafinha on the verge of Real Betis loan for 1.5m,"Barcelona are ready to loan Rafinha to Real Betis. Negotiations between the two clubs are advanced and a deal could be sealed in the coming days. Rafinha would go for the season in exchange for 1.5 million euros, plus 500,000 euros if they win a trophy or reach the Champions League. They will also pay the player's whole salary during the loan spell. Betis and Barca are also discussing an option to buy Rafinha for 25 million euros. If he does leave it will be a good loan for him to get minutes and keep growing as it is hard to imagine him having a lot of time at Barcelona even though Ernesto Valverde was pleased with his performances in pre-season.",FALSE
1036,Rafinha to swap Barca for Betis?,"The agent and father of Barcelona's Rafinha Alcantara is in Seville to negotiate the midfielder's loan move to Real Betis, say reports. The Brazil midfielder spent the season half of last season on loan at Inter ‚Äì who have once again been linked with him ‚Äì but he netted in last week's Joan Gamper trophy win over Boca Juniors. El Mundo Deportivo, RAC1 and Sevilla Info all report that Mazinho is discussing with officials at Los Verdiblancos, although 'no deal has yet been closed'. Rafinha made 17 appearances in Serie A for the Nerazzuri last season after a January loan, starting 12 of those games and has been linked with a host of clubs this summer. The Milanese giants had a ‚Ç¨40m option to sign the midfielder on a permanent basis but failed to raise the funds in time and Rafinha returned to the Camp Nou. Betis have also been linked with moves for Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko and Barca striker Paco Alcacer.",FALSE
1037,Barcelona Transfer News: Rafinha Set for Real Betis Loan in Latest Rumours,"Rafinha is reportedly on the verge of sealing another loan move away from Barcelona, this time to Real Betis . According to Sport (h/t Goal ), after spending the second half of last season at Inter Milan , the Brazilian midfielder will secure a season-long move to Betis on Wednesday. Rafinha has always found regular first team action hard to come by at the Camp Nou. He made his senior Barca debut in 2011 after coming through the club's youth system, but he has never earned more than 14 La Liga starts in a full season. The competition is simply too intense at Barcelona. Rafinha can play as a central midfielder or on the right flank, but he is behind the likes of Lionel Messi, Ivan Rakitic, Philippe Coutinho, Arturo Vidal and Ousmane Dembele in the pecking order at the Catalan giants. For Betis, though, he should be a superb addition. As noted by WhoScored.com before his temporary January move to Inter, the Brazil international boasts an exciting combination of attributes: .@Inter yesterday confirmed the signing of @Rafinha from Barcelona His statistically calculated WhoScored strengths, weaknesses and styles of play should certainly excite fans... https://t.co/6zrF1nkRIw There is no shame in Rafinha not being able to secure a starting spot in one of the best sides in the world and it certainly doesn't make him a poor player. At Betis, he could be a major star. And, after the club impressed hugely with a sixth-place La Liga finish last term, Rafinha will also have the opportunity to help Betis in their UEFA Europa League campaign.",FALSE
1038,Barcelona ace Rafinha set to join Real Betis on loan with obligation to buy at end of season,"RAFINHA is set to join Real Betis on loan with an obligation to buy at the end of the season, according to reports. The midfielder - younger brother of Bayern Munich ace Thiago - has struggled to gain a first-team spot at the Nou Camp. And Spanish outlet Sport claims Betis are closing in on a deal which would see them pay ¬£1.5million up front and another 22.5m next summer. Their report adds that Barca insisted on the compulsory purchase as they look to move on from Rafinha, 25. The Brazilian joined Inter Milan on loan in January and played 17 times but has not been brought back to Italy. Barca have until the European window closes on Friday to complete their transfer business. They have been linked with Manchester United skipper Paul Pogba , but are highly unlikely to agree a deal before then. Gerard Pique has left fans in do doubt about the club's interest as he paid tribute to the Frenchman. He said: ""I don't know about his relationship with Mourinho. ""We'll see in the future, but we would be very happy to see Pogba in Barca's shirt. ""Pogba is a very good player, but a Manchester United player right now, and we'll see if anything happens in the future. ""We would be happy to have him here, but Manchester United is his club and, if someone has to say something, it must be them.""",FALSE
1039,What's going on with Rafinha's move to Real Betis?,"The departure which is taking the longest time to complete is Rafinha's. Why? Maybe that shouldn't be viewed as a negative as it's the one deal Ernesto Valverde doesn't want to go through. The coach has told the board, and the player, that he's part of his plans for this season. However the fact Rafinha wasn't named in the squad for the match against Valladolid might mean that Valverde's accepted defeat in keeping Rafinha at the club. However the reason this transfer hasn't moved forward is simply down to money. Real Betis are the side interested in Rafinha but it isn't an easy deal to pull off. Barcelona believe, with the player's contract running out in 2020, that they can't let a player leave on loan without a complusary purchase being agreed at the end of it. Bar√ßa did this before with Inter Milan, although that fee wasn't complusary, and got their fingers burnt. Not again. This means Bar√ßa are willing to let the situation drag on even longer as they look to agree a fee in the region of ‚Ç¨20m for the midfielder. This is a sum beyond Betis' means. They are, however, happy to pay a loan fee and cover the player's wages for the season. In the end it appears inevitable that Rafinha will leave on a loan deal and Bar√ßa will try to get the maximum amount for an initial fee, as well as on a future transfer. The issues don't stop there as Betis are only willing to accept a compulsary purchase if the player fulfills certain requirements, be that individual or collective achievements. Then it wouldn't really be compulsary. In Sevilla they believe Bar√ßa are trying to get Rafinha to sign a new contract before he's loaned out so that a decision can be made on his future next summer. Whatever the case, it appears that Rafinha will leave the club in the next few hours. The player is convinced by the project at Betis and values the fact Quique Setien is pushing for him to join the team. It would represent quite the signing for Betis but they are in a race against the clock. As we've seen already in this market, things can change at the last minute.",FALSE
1040,Quique Setien confirms Real Betis' interest in Bar√ßa's Rafinha,"After signing six players and recalling Darko Brasanac , Real Betis are now focused on signing Rafinha Alcantara before the transfer window shuts. Since the possibility of a deal came up, coach Quique Setien has made it clear that he's in complete favour of bringing the midfielder in, but negotiations are not proving easy. Betis want Rafinha on loan, taking care of his three million per year salary, but Bar√ßa only want to sell or for the loan to have an obligatory option to buy at the end of the season. With seven days left in the transfer window, there's a belief in Seville that Bar√ßa's demands will drop from 30 million euros as deadline day approaches. Setien spoke about the issue in a news conference on Friday: ""Rafinha perfectly understands out proposal and he can add a lot of things to our team. He's a top-level player and I am sure that he would be really good for us."" Therefore, the Betis coach confirmed the reports that had come out about the midfielder's future, with conversations held with form Bar√ßa teammates Cristian Tello and Marc Bartra, too. ""We have a lot of good players in our squad, but it's clear that if Rafinha comes, the level would go up,"" Setien added.",FALSE
1041,Rafinha is very close to joining Real Betis on loan,"Rafinha's move to Real Betis appeared to be dead in the water earlier after the two sides couldn't reach an agreement, but in the last few hours the situation has changed and everything suggests a deal will be completed by the end of the week. Betis will pay Bar√ßa a loan fee and cover the midfielder's wages for the duration of his stay. There will also be an option to make the move permanent at the end of the season. Rafinha has given the move his blessing and is awaiting an agreement between the two clubs. The conversations between Barcelona and Betis began last week. Bar√ßa initially wanted a permanent deal, asking for an offer in excess of ‚Ç¨25m. This is a fee Betis couldn't dream of paying and instead offered the chance to buy part of the player's economic rights. However this wasn't a route that Barcelona were interested in going down. Neither side was willing to give an inch. And just as it looked as if the deal was dead, Betis offered a loan fee and to cover the player's full wages for the season. Bar√ßa will earn over ‚Ç¨1m for the initial fee and it'll free up the club from paying his salary for 12 months. The option to buy price is to Barcelona's liking although it isn't obligatory. Rafinha is desperate to play regular football and hopes he can make a difference at Betis. A deal is very close to being finalised now.",FALSE
1043,Huddersfield after Patrick Roberts,"According to 'Sky Sports', Huddersfield would like to bolster their attacking options and Roberts, who does not appear part of Pep Guardiola's plans for this season, would fit the billing. The 21-year-old has spent the last few seasons on loan in Scotland at Celtic , winning back-to-back domestic trebles and competing in the Champions League. Roberts travelled to the United States with the 'Citizens' for their pre-season tour , though has only made three appearances for Pep Guardiola's side since joining from Fulham in 2015. The player has featured in the England set-up from the under-16 team to the under-20 team, and with regular football at Huddersfield could put himself in contention for a place in Gareth Southgate's team. It is thought 'City' may prefer a permanent deal for Roberts , though a loan is not out of the question.",FALSE

It is understood Huddersfield are in the market for a wide player and would like to strengthen that area of the squad. Roberts has spent the last two-and-a-half years on loan at Celtic where he made 79 appearances and was part of the side which won back-to-back domestic trebles. The 21-year-old was included in City's pre-season tour of the United States and made substitute appearances in International Champions Cup matches against Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool.

But should he still be at the Premier League champions beyond Thursday's English transfer deadline, the Hoops could make their move. Rodgers is also set to land another City starlet in Daniel Arzani, who is on the verge of signing a two-year loan deal at Parkhead. And Rae added: ""It's one of the things that Celtic have done in recent years. ""They've brought in Patrick Roberts, they've brought in young Lewis Morgan as well. ""Sinclair hasn't really hit the heights, he's been in and out of the team in the last six months or so and he's not really featured this year. ""So he may well be one that might go out the door. They might want to freshen things up. It's exciting times because they have so many options.

Our eyes are open to lots of options. ""Patrick is a fantastic player and we are always going to be interested in top class players.""

1134,Joe Hart completes ¬£3.5m move from Manchester City to Burnley,"J oe Hart has ended his 12-year stay at Manchester City after signing for Burnley, who now boast three England goalkeepers on their books. Hart, who has agreed a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee thought to be around ¬£3.5m, has been looking for a permanent club after season-long loans at Torino and West Ham. The Clarets emerged as an unexpected destination after injuries to Nick Pope and Tom Heaton. Manager Sean Dyche decided to enter the market with Pope facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after dislocating his shoulder in the Europa League qualifier at Aberdeen and Heaton returning to fitness after a calf strain. Hart has known he had no future at the Etihad Stadium, where he played a key role in two Premier League title wins and three cup successes over the course of 348 appearances, ever since Pep Guardiola's arrival as manager. The 31-year-old's situation became even more stark when he was axed by England manager Gareth Southgate on the eve of this summer's World Cup, with Pope beating him to a place in the final 23 and Heaton named on standby.

C ity chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak led the praise in a statement which read: ""Joe Hart's contribution to Manchester City cannot be overstated. ""His 12 years at the club have seen him produce some remarkable performances and heart-stopping saves that will live in the memory for a long time to come. His passion for and commitment to this Club, evidenced by a remarkable tally of 348 appearances, means he will rightly be regarded as a City legend in perpetuity.

""When you look at the club he joined and the club as it is now, we have come so far during his time in Manchester and Joe has been a huge part of that.

1135,Danny Ings completes ¬£20m Southampton move,"D anny Ings has completed a ¬£20 million move to Southampton, initially on a season-long loan but with a commitment for an additional three years. Ings completed a complicated switch to St Mary's after the club's agreed the structure of payments ahead of the close of business. Although his first year will be on loan, Southampton have committed to buy the striker on July 1, 2019. Liverpool are guaranteed ¬£18 million, with a further ¬£2 million based on appearances. Despite both clubs insisting his next 12 months is part of a loan deal, the 26-year-old has signed a four-year contract until 2022. Liverpool will also receive 20 per cent of any future sale of Ings. ""There was significant competition for Danny, with a lot of clubs keen to complete a deal for him, so we're clearly delighted that he chose to join us,"" said Southampton manager Mark Hughes. ""We have admired him for some time now, not only for his ability, but also his character and personality. He's obviously a local boy, who gives us another excellent option up front and has a real point to prove."" S outhampton had completed most of their transfer business relatively early in the summer following the permanent appointment Hughes. Although playmaker Dusan Tadic was sold, he has been replaced by two creative players in Moi Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong. A ngus Gunn has been brought in as goalkeeping back-up while Jannik Vestergaard was signed following the release of Florin Gardos.

1136,Loris Karius ends turbulent Liverpool time with two-year loan move to Besiktas,"L oris Karius's turbulent time at Liverpool is set to come to an end after the club agreed a two-year loan deal with Turkish side Besiktas. The goalkeeper, who made two costly errors in last season's Champions League final, has fallen down the pecking order following the arrival of Alisson Becker for ¬£67m in the summer. If Karius agrees to the move, his departure will result in Simon Mignolet, who had been expected to leave this summer, serving as Jurgen Klopp's second-choice goalkeeper this season. Karius travelled with the Liverpool squad to London for Monday night's meeting with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park but was not included on the bench. Besiktas will pay a ¬£2.25m loan fee to Liverpool, and would pay ¬£7.25m if the deal becomes permanent. Liverpool paid ¬£4.75m for Karius in the summer of 2016 and will receive 20 per cent of any future fee should Besiktas choose to sell him. K arius's standing at the club was damaged by his performance at the Champions League, although it later emerged that he had sustained a concussion prior to making two horrendous errors in Liverpool's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid. He was not helped by a poor start to pre-season, though, and the signing of Alisson made it clear that he no longer featured in Klopp's plans. L iverpool have also sold Danny Ward, another goalkeeper, this summer after agreeing a ¬£12.5m deal with Leicester City. Meanwhile, Brighton defender Leon Balogun has said that playing Liverpool will be ""a lot more intense"" than Manchester United after making his Premier League debut in Sunday's 3-2 victory over Jose Mourinho's side. Balogun, who joined Brighton on a free transfer from German outfit Mainz in the summer, said he expects Klopp's side to to be much ""faster"" than United, who struggled to create chances at the Amex Stadium. A sked after the game how his first experience of the Premier League compared to the Bundesliga, Balogun said: ""Some of the lads have just asked me that too and I said I had expected [the Premier League] to be quicker. ""But they told me this is always the kind of game you play against United. They like to slow it down a little bit sometimes. ""Liverpool is going to be completely different. I know how Klopp likes to play. It is going to be a lot quicker and a lot more intense.""",TRUE

More to follow. pic.twitter.com/bkyAuXKlMS And the final touches to the deal have now been completed to allow Hart to leave the club after 12 years at the Etihad Stadium. Hart has taken the opportunity Sean Dyche has offered of starting the season as his first-choice goalkeeper following injuries to Nick Pope and Tom Heaton. Pope is out long-term and Heaton has a calf problem, prompting Dyche to move for Hart ahead of Sunday's Premier League opener at Southampton. Pope and Heaton edged out Hart for a place in the England squad for their World Cup run to the semi-finals, with Gareth Southgate naming Heaton as a standby. Hart's move to Burnley gives him the opportunity to fight for a way back into Southgate's plans. He spent last year on loan at West Ham, though the Hammers opted not to sign him permanently. Torino took him on loan the previous year after Pep Guardiola decided he was not part of his plans. Burnley have also added Ben Gibson in a ¬£15million move from Middlesbrough, with the centre-back also hoping to earn a Three Lions recall.",TRUE

The Spanish giants paid Brazilian side Palmeiras just over ¬£10m in January before impressing at the World Cup for Colombia and attracting interest from Manchester United among other clubs. But it was Marco Silva and Everton that were able to convince the 23-year-old to join after just six appearances for Barcelona.

Huddersfield, Bordeaux and Rennes were among the clubs making moves for him, but Girona - who are part owned by City Football Group - had a head-start and have won the race for his signature. City have a habit of sending youngsters to Girona, last season there were five players on loan with the La Liga side, and as he is highly rated at the Etihad he'll remain within their group. Roberts could be thrown straight in the deep end with a debut lined up against European champions Real Madrid. Girona open their season tomorrow evening against Valladolid but it may come too soon for Roberts. Their next contest comes against Julen Lopetegui's men on August 26. Although the transfer deadline has passed for a Premier League move, clubs can still loan their players abroad and to lower divisions.",TRUE
1141,Liverpool transfer news: Loris Karius signing 'announced' by Besiktas with accidental Twitter change,"LORIS KARIUS' Liverpool stint appears to be coming to an end after Besiktas posted a picture of the goalkeeper on their Twitter page before then removing it. The German shot-stopper had been heavily linked with a move away from Anfield this summer following the arrival of Alisson from Roma for ¬£67million . Turkish side Besiktas were widely tipped to be the destination for the 25-year-old although no official confirmation had been forthcoming. But a subtle change to their official club banner would suggest that may not be far away as Karius' name was flashed across the new version. That was also accompanied with a picture of the keeper in the club's colours before the club then swiftly removed it. It would bring an end to a turbulent few months for Karius who was at fault for two goals during Liverpool's 3-1 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid last summer. Manager Jurgen Klopp came out in defence of his player afterwards and he still supported him despite further clangers in pre-season against Tranmere and Borussia Dortmund. But that support would not prevent a U-turn from Klopp who has now decided the keeper is no longer part of his plans. Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of tomorrow's clash with Brighton, he said: There's nothing new about Loris. If it happens that's how it goes in football, these things can happen. ""As a manager you don't usually need much time between one game and another to get the sack, that's how things can change. Things in football change.""",TRUE

According to HLN , Alderweireld 'absolutely' wants to leave Tottenham this summer and is hopeful that United can reach an agreement with Spurs. Spurs are demanding a ¬£60 million fee for the Belgium international but face the prospect of selling him for ¬£25m next summer when a clause is activated in his contract. Tottenham also want Anthony Martial included as part of the deal but while Mourinho is happy for the France international to leave, Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, wants to keep the player at Old Trafford.

However that might change now that Arsenal are interested in the player. Unai Emery is a huge fan of Gomes, so much so that he's willing to sell one of Arsenal's star players, Aaron Ramsey, in order to bring in the central midfielder. According to English newspaper 'The Independent', Arsenal are willing to offer a fee of around ‚Ç¨30m for Gomes if they are able to sell Ramsey first.

1145,Jack Grealish's desired transfer to Spurs may come down to... Jack Grealish personally persuading Aston Villa's owners to sell him,"T ottenham Hotspur's late attempt to sign Jack Grealish will come down to whether the player himself can persuade Aston Villa's new billionaire owners to let him go after the rejection of Tuesday night's ¬£25 million bid left any potential deal on the rocks. The failure of the two sides to reach agreement has been a grave disappointment to Grealish, who feels that he has given the club good service since their relegation two years ago and wants to move up a division to a Champions League club. He strongly wants to leave, although his club's new owners, the Egyptian businessman Nassef Sawiris and his American counterpart Wes Edens, are understandably reluctant to let him do so at the current price. It has been made clear to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy thus far that the England Under-21 international is not for sale at ¬£25 million and it seems Spurs will have to go above ¬£30 million at the very least to have any chance of negotiating a sale ‚Äì although even that might not be enough. Levy goes into the final day of a summer transfer window still yet to make a new signing having been told publicly by Mauricio Pochettino at the end of last season that the club had to be ""bold"" to move forward. S purs were also one of the key driving forces in pushing through the new rules to make the transfer window shorter than it had been in previous years, finishing before the new season started, which has caused problems for many clubs. G realish believed that he had an informal agreement that he could leave Villa with the former owner Tony Xia, who retains a stake in the club but is not now making the major decisions. Villa made the signing of 23-year-old Scotland international John McGinn from Hibernian for a fee thought to be around ¬£3 million. W hether Grealish can appeal directly to the owners of his boyhood club to make the move happen may yet be Spurs' best option, with their plan of capitalising on a Villa firesale under the Xia ownership having failed badly. Spurs and Levy had been confident that Villa's precarious financial position earlier in the window would force a sale but the investment from the new owners has changed the picture. S awiris and Edens now face a judgment call, balancing Grealish's state of mind going into a third season playing in the Championship, the reaction of Villa supporters to a late sale and the needs of the team. Had Spurs offered more for the 22-year-old, and earlier in the window, it might have been an easier sale but there is an understandable reluctance at Villa Park to be pushed into a move by a characteristically late Spurs bid. One deal which Spurs might be able to proceed with is a loan move for left-back Danny Rose to Schalke. The two clubs are understood to be in talks.",FALSE

Spurs' pursuit of the 22-year-old star late into the transfer window was one of the most talked about transfer sagas this summer. The Premier League side had hoped to land the youngster on the cheap due to Villa's financial difficulties, but a takeover from an American financer and Egyptian billionaire handed control back to the Midlands club. Grealish stayed at Villa Park, with the Championship outfit refusing to sell despite an 11 th hour ¬£30million bid . Tottenham ultimately ended the summer transfer window without signing any new players ‚Äì a first in Premier League history. Spurs were linked with an interest in Grealish for most of the off-season, but waited until late in the window to make their first offer.

Not that he's complaining‚Ä¶ ""It's fair to say we were in such a bad position financially that if Tottenham had have done their work early, then I'm sure he would have been a Tottenham player,"" the Villa boss said on Friday's Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast.

""There was a time where I thought we were going to lose Jonathan Kodjia, lose Jack Grealish, lose James Chester, all the players who were obviously going to attract big money, but thankfully we've managed to hold onto them."" Bruce also added that Grealish is set to sign a new and improved contract with the Villa, and that he is hoping to get the funds to make a few late signings before the window shuts on August 31. ""Jack will certainly will be in line for a new deal,"" the manager added. ""The new owners have said that and I think they want to make a statement on it.

""The new owners came in, did their due diligence and when I met them, I think they realised who our best player was,"" he said. ""It doesn't take you long because his name has been all over the back pages every day.

""We're a Championship club and Spurs are in the Champions League. The attraction to Jack is inevitable. I'm aware that there's a human being at the centre of all this.
